This little program can make an access log for certain pages, and the log file can be analyzed by other log analyzing software. If you want to get the combined format log with referer and user agent information, or you want to know the referer information of certain pages, but your hosting provider doesn't offer access log downloading, or just provide the common format log, then you can use this program.
 
Steps of installing:

1.Upload the files in the zip file(except the /emptylog/) to a same directory, such as /logwriter/.
2.Then edit logwriter.php. Please edit $logwriter_logdir to the physical directory where the file is. If you are not clear, please run path.php.
3.Please edit $logwriter_timezone to the time zone where your server is.  
4.Set access.log to 777.
5.Add "<?php require "./logwriter/logwriter.php"; ?>" to any page you want to track.

Hint:
To save the system resources, please upload the empty log in the /emptylog/ to overwrite after a certain period.
