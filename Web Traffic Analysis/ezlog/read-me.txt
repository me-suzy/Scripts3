Title:
EZ-Logger

Coded By:
Eric [eric1207@gmail.com]

Purpose:
None (Got bored and started coding)

Notes:
Yes, if you actually understand the Internet, PHP, etc., I do realize
I have added so much help information to this script that it is absolutely
ridiculous, but suprisngly their are actually programmers who think they
know it all, but don't know the first thing about what an IP address, hostname,?
or referrer is. Enjoy..

# HOW TO USE #
##############

Only email me asking questions if you have tried everything possible
and you do not know why it's not working or if you've found an error in
my poorly written code.

To use this, make sure the page you want to use this with has a .PHP
filename extension and type "<? include ("ezlog.php"); ?>" at the very
top of that page. Read below for more information about each service.

/* HOW TO LOG  VISITORS */

When logging visitors, create a file called "log.txt" and every visitors
information will be written to a separate line when they view your website.

/* HOW TO BAN */

IP address's are just a series of numbers describing another persons
connection to the internet.

To properly ban people, create a file called "banned.txt" and put the
IP address or hostname of the person you are banning. For every
person you are banning, start a new line in the file.

So if you want to ban all aol users, verzion users, and 123.456.78.90,
you're banned.txt contents would looke like this:

aol.com
verizon.net
123.456.78.90

If you put ".", everyone is banned because "." is in every hostname and IP.
If you put "aol.com", aol users are banned because "aol.com" is in their hostname.
If you put "123.456.78.90", then only the person with that IP is banned.
If you put "123", anyone with "123" in their hostname or IP is banned.

/* HOW TO LOG REFERRERS */

Referrers are just other websites which have linked your website.

When logging referrers, create a file called "referrers.txt" and every time
someone clicks a link to your website on another website and 

Pretend aol.com had a link to your website and someone clicked
it and showed up at your website, well this script would log everything
about the person that clicked the link and the website that they came from.

/* NOTE */

If you are hosted on a UNIX/Linux server [you would know if you are],
then chmod banned.txt, log.txt, and referrers.txt to 0666.

Enjoy...
