 ip2country.php - identify country from ip for showlog

 i2country function was initially written by http://www.php.net developers,
 modified (fixed) by Bakr Alsharif (http://SysTurn.com) (opening April 2005),
 and completely recoded and fastened for weblog / showlog by Daniel Sokoll 

 ip2country uses the IP-to-Country Database provided by WebHosting.Info
 (http://www.webhosting.info), available from http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info.
 This script uses the local copy of the ip-to-country.com database

 Modifications of the previous versions of php.net developers and Bakr Alsharif:
  - Databaseformat:  country code [2 bytes / letters]
  - completely recoded the identify-routine for much more performance
  - added 'ip2country_create_db.php' to create SHOWlog/WEBlog-compatible
    'ip2country.db'-Database.
  - removed index, because new identify-routine is faster without index
  - removed 'example.php' from Bakr Alsharif (http://SysTurn.com)
  - added 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) to database
