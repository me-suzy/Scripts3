Some information about the identify-modules:

- Bots will be identified by plain text in "modules/ident_bot.inc.php". You
  can modify known bots in "config/bots.dat" with a normal texteditor.
  The last line of the botlist-file is the botlist-date and will not be used
  for bot-identifying.

- Searchengines will be identified by "modules/ident_search.inc.php".

- Browser and os will be identified with "modules/ident_browser.inc.php"
  and "modules/ident_os.inc.php". Here you need massive knowledge of
  PHP and regular expressions to modify the identify-routine.

- Countries will be identified by "modules/ident_country.inc.php".
- Countrynames were defined in "languages/c_de.dat" and "languages/c_en.dat".
- Countryflags were defined in "countries/c_flags.dat".
- To update the IP2Country-database please download and unzip the .csv-file
  from "http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/" to countries-dir.
  Then call create_ip2c_db.php (in countries-directory) with Webinterface. A
  new ip2c-database will be generated.

- Languages will be identified by "modules/ident_languages.inc.php".
  Ident_languages uses the countryflags of "modules/ident_country.inc.php".
  the languages were defined in "languages/l_de.dat" and "languages/l_en.dat"
  seperated by "|".
  Example: en-nz|nz|English (New Zealand)
  that means: languagecode|flag|shown text
