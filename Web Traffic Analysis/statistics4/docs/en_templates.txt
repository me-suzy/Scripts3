SHOWlog uses a "simple to use" template-system.

To built your own template just create a folder in the template-directory and name
it with your desired template-name.

Then create a HTML-file called 'statistics.html' in your folder.
In this file you have to start every link to your own files (e.g. images, css...)
with '<%TPLPATH%>', e.g. ' href="<%TPLPATH%>statistics.css" '.

Special vars that will be replaced after reading the template:
  <%VERSION%>			will be replaced with the SHOWlog version ($showlog_ver)
  <%LANGUAGECODE%>	replaced by languagecode ($lang_code) e.g. 'de' or 'en'
  <%REFRESH%>			at this position the METATAG 'REFRESH' will be written
  <%TPLPATH%>			will be replaced by the template-path
  <%CONTENT%>			here the content will be shown

A second file is necessary: a Stylesheet-file, e.g. 'statistics.css'.
The best way to built your own Stylesheet is to copy and modify an existing stylesheet-file
into your own template-directory, so you can't miss a necessary class.

If you want to share your template, send it as a compressed file (e.g. .zip) to fli4l@sirsocke.de
I will upload it to the showlog homepage.

If you need to modify the templatefunction: 'templates/template.inc.php'
