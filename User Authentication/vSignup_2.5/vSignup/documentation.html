<p class="style5">vSignup is a member registration script which utilizes vAuthenticate 
for its security handling. This handy script features email verification, 
sending confirmation email message, restricting email domains that are 
allowed for membership, and much more.</p>
<p class="style5">vSignup is an offshoot of what vAuthenticate can do. It provides a 
  member-signup form which integrates well with vAuthenticate to 
create a powerful signup-and-authentication system for your site.</p>
<p class="style5"><u>FEATURES:</u><br>
  <br>
  1. Speed 
  - vSignup uses the dynamic-duo of PHP and MySQL which enables 
  blazing fast transactions where only your server speed dictates 
  the limit.</p>
<p class="style5">2. Compactness 
  - vSignup is very small thus taking up little space allowing  
  you more room to enhance your site's other features.</p>
<p class="style5">3. Authentication Settings 
  - vSignup allows you to configure whether the system will 
  automatically approve new membership request or not. It also 
  allows you to turn the email notification on or off. You also have 
  the option to let the system send the admin an automatic email 
  message everytime a new member signs up.</p>
<p class="style5"> 4. Email Verification
  - vSignup provides a standard email verification function to 
  ensure that the email address specified in the field is 
  valid in terms of format.</p>
<p class="style5"> 5. Email Confirmation Message
  - vSignup can sends out a confirmation email to the visitor who
  signed up to make sure that the email address he/she 
  specified is really his/hers.</p>
<p class="style5"> 6. Restriction on Email Domains
  - vSignup allows you to restrict the people who signs up for
  membership by validating that their email address is in 
  your list of allowable domains.</p>
<p class="style5">7. Emailer Profiles
  - vSignup allows the you to enter multiple Emailer profiles. These
  profiles allow you to set some predefined email messages to send 
  to members during confirmation so that there will be a variety 
  of templates to choose from.</p>
<p class="style5">8. Password Reminder
  - vSignup can rest a member's password in case they forget it.</p>

<p class="style6">Upgrading:<a name="Upgrading" id="Upgrading"></a></p>
<p class="style5"> Upgrading is not really recommended from any lower version of vSignup to this latest version of vSignup due to the drastic schema and business logic changes. if you are running on a previous version of vSignup, it is suggested that you backup your MySQL database or at least the tables associated with vSignup and then re-import the data one table at a time to the new vSIgnup tables. Take note that the password field for the authuser table has changed to 32 character-width and is in an encrypted form. The suggested approach is to clear out the value for the password once you import the old authuser data to the new authuser table. After doing this, execute the following statements in your database user interface such as phpMyAdmin:</p>
<p class="style10">UPDATE authuser SET passwd=MD5('access') WHERE uname='sa' OR uname='admin'</p>
<p class="style5">The above statement should set your sa and admin users' password to the proper form. Login to vSignup after this and change each member's password one at a time at the vSignup User Administration page. This should encrypt each member's password using MD5.</p>
<hr>
<p class="style6">Installation:<a name="Installation" id="Installation"></a></p>
<p class="style5">1. Launch your database manager (phpMyAdmin) for MySQL and run the createdb.sql file. </p>
<p class="style5">2. Modify authconfig.php to match your database settings and your file pathing. </p>
<p class="style5">3. Modify auth.php to match your database settings.</p>
<p class="style5">4. Modify signup config to match your database settings, file pathing, and administrator email address.</p>
<p class="style5">5. You can modify the login.php page to suit your needs or better yet, use your own page and include a login box. One of the rules is that you SHOULD include the authconfig.php in whichever page you will have your login box at (let's say, your index.php). Also, take note of these requirements for the login box:</p>
<table width="80%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr class="style5">
    <td valign="top"><div align="right">a.&nbsp;</div></td>
    <td>The page where the login box is located should be a PHP file, not an HTML file. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="style5">
    <td width="8%" valign="top"><div align="right">b.&nbsp;</div></td>
    <td width="92%">Login box's form action parameter should be set to <span class="style11">&lt;?php echo $resultpage; ?&gt;</span> as it gets the value from the authconfig.php that we included.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="style5">
    <td valign="top"><div align="right">c.&nbsp;</div></td>
    <td>The username field should have a name of 'username' without the quotes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="style5">
    <td valign="top"><div align="right">d.&nbsp;</div></td>
    <td>The password field should have a name of 'password' without the quotes.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="style5">6. All files under the admin folder must remain that way. The admin folder 
itself MUST reside inside the folder where vSignup is located. 
Although you can change this in authconfig.php, it is not recommended 
to change the line unless you know a great deal about server-side 
includes and pathname resolution.</p>
<p class="style5">7. The members directory can be anywhere as vSignup allows you to protect files outside the vSignup folder as long as the protected file is a PHP file and it has proper pathing for the 3 include files (auth.php, authconfig.php, andcheck.php).</p>
<p class="style5">8. Upload all files to your server using ASCII. You can disregard createdb.sql (we have already used it in step 1), README.txt, documentation.html, AuthClass.txt, and faq.txt as these are not used in the script itself.</p>

<p class="style5">After installation, 5 tables will be created in your database. These tables are: authuser, authteam, emailer, signup, and signupsetup. To administer vSignup, do the following:</p>

</table>
<p class="style5"><span class="style12">* IMPORTANT:</span><br>
There are 3 interrelated fields in the Settings page:<br>
1. <span class="style17">Automatically activate membership upon signup</span> - This will set the member's status as active or inactive. If set to inactive, the administrator must manually activate the user UNLESS the user has an email notification that has the confirmation link URL. <br>
2. <span class="style17">Send email notification after signing up</span> - This will trigger an email to be sent to the new member. The email that will be sent would depend on the default profile selected.<br>
3. <span class="style17">Choose default profile if sending email notification</span> - This is the default email that will be sent to the new member ASSUMING that the the system is set to send email notification after signing up. This default profile may or may not contain the confirmation link URL needed to allow the user to activate their membership. </p>
<p class="style5">Because of this interralationship, it is recommended that if membership is NOT set to be activated automatically, &quot;Send email notification after signing up&quot; should be set to Yes and the default profile should be something that has the confirmation URL in it (via the [[CONFIRM]] key. Any other combination for the said scenario might result in a logic flaw and the administrator will have to activate each member manually. </p>
<hr>
<p class="style6">Usage:<a name="Usage" id="Usage"></a></p>
<p class="style5">Although vSignup works out of the box, it is more likely than not that you will need to make some modifications to the code to match your needs. As such, you will need to have some knowledge on PHP, specifically on condition statements.</p>
<p class="style5">ALL records in the authuser table contains the following info:<br>
1. <strong>id</strong> (use $check[&quot;id&quot;] to get the unique id) - this is used for sorting 
purposes only and can be used as an alternative primary key<br>
2. <strong>username</strong> (use $check[&quot;uname&quot;] to get the username) - this is the 
username of the member<br>
3. <strong>password</strong> (use $check[&quot;passwd&quot;] to get the passwd) - this is the 
password of the member<br>
4. <strong>team</strong> (use $check[&quot;team&quot;] to get the team name) - this is the 
teamname of the member<br>
5. <strong>level</strong> (use $check[&quot;level&quot;] to get the level) - this is the 
level of the member<br>
6. <strong>status</strong> (use $check[&quot;status&quot;] to get the status) - this is the 
status of the member which can either be active or inactive<br>
7. <strong>lastlogin</strong> (use $check[&quot;lastlogin&quot;] to get the last login date and time) - 
this is a timestamp on the last lagin date and time of a member.<br>
8. <strong>logincount</strong> (use $check[&quot;logincount&quot;] to get count) - this is a 
counter which increments everytime a member/admin logs in.</p>
<p class="style5">For example, login to the members area as a member and you'll see that there are 2 examples provided. One is to restrict by level and the 
other is to restrict by group.</p>
<p> <span class="style5">You may use auth.php to automatically add users to the DB from your 
  existing signup form. BUT, to do this, you would need to have an 
  understanding of what auth.php returns for each transaction 
  you make. For more info regarding this, check out AuthClass.txt</span></p>
<p class="style5"> To secure pages, you would need to add the following lines on top of the pages 
you want to secure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style10"> &lt;?php<br>
    include_once (&quot;path/to/auth.php&quot;);<br>
    include_once (&quot;path/to/authconfig.php&quot;);<br>
    include_once (&quot;path/to/check.php&quot;); <br>
    ?&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style5"> where path/to/ refers to the path of the files relative to the current 
  directory of the file being secured. For an example, please see 
  page2.php. If you haven' logged in yet or have logged in using a 
  wrong username and password, you will get an Illegal Access 
  error on page2.php. However, if you have logged in successfully
  and without closing the browser, you tried accessing page2.php, 
you'll notice that you can see the message (2 to 3 lines) in the file.</p>
<p class="style5"> Take note that adding those &quot;include lines&quot; on top of your secured pages only 
  facilitate in checking of the username and password combination stored 
  in the cookie. This is to protect it from direct file access. If you want to add 
  the necessary authentication code that takes note of the rules
  (for example, only level 4 members can access this page; or only<br>
  members from the Friends group/team are allowed to see this page) that 
  you've made to be available in this file too, you must add some more PHP code for that. Please refer to the demo users for more information.</p>
<p class="style5">Some files you can directly link to from your website are:<br>
  1. signup.php (unless you have a different signup form) <br>
  2. members/userdetail.php (assuming the user is logged in, they can change their details here) <br>
  3. login.php (unless you have a different login form - like if it is in your index.php)<br>
  4. logout.php (you can check out the code and use it in your own logout page)<br>
  5. chgpwd.php (assuming the user is logged in, they can change their password here)<br>
  6. pwdremind.php</p>
<p class="style5"><span class="style12">IMPORTANT:</span><br>
vSignup uses a slightly-modified version of vAuthenticate. If you want to use
vSignup in your site but you already have vAuthenticate installed, you would have to remove the current install of vAuthenticate before installing 
vSignup. After you install vSignup, you can then use the vAuthenticate that comes with it.</p>
<hr>
<p class="style6">Demonstration:<a name="Demonstration" id="Demonstration"></a></p>
<p class="style5">Here's a little something to let you test out and learn how to restrict access to pages 
on a per-group or per-level basis.</p>
<p class="style5">1. Login as &quot;sa&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; without the quotes<br>
2. Notice that there are usernames called G1-0001, G1-0002, etc.<br>
3. Click on these and take note of the team they are a part of and their level.<br>
4. For you to remember them easily, a convention was used for the usernames.<br>

G1-0001 stands for the first user under Group 1.<br>
G1-0002 stands for the second user under Group 1.<br>
G2-0001 stands for the first user under Group 2.<br>
... and so on ...

  5. Logoff as &quot;sa&quot; or &quot;admin&quot;<br>
  6. Login as any of the users (except sa, admin, and test). Take note that their 
password is by default, &quot;access&quot; (unless you change them of course)<br>
7. You will be taken to the members' index page. Here, you'll see 2 links for
demo purposes.<br>
8. Depending on the user you logged in with and the credentials that come with 
that user, you might or might not see the intended content for 
the bygroup.php and bylevel.php.</p>
