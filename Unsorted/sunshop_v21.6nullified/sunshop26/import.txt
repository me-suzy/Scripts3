In order to import products from a csv file or "comma delimited" file your file must meet the 
following guidlines.

One: Your data cannot contain any commas other then the ones seperating the values or the data 
will be inputed incorectly. 

Two: Some versions of MySQL do not like the use of quotation marks or single quotes. If you get
any errors generated, this may be the cause of the problem. 

Three: The general format for the files is as follows:
(If you wish to leave a field empty you may skip it but you must leave the empty space where it 
belongs.)
