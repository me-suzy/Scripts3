** Instructions


Step 1:
Open newsportal.php and adjust the variables in the beginning.


Step 2:
Take the newsportal.txt, newsportal_threadbit.txt and newsportal_newsbit.txt files, and put their contents into new custom templates using those names respectively (minus the extension .txt of course :p ).


Step 3:
Upload newsportal.php to your vb's root folder.


Step 4:
Add a link to newsportal.php on your site somewhere, so that people actually know it exists ^_^
(best link would be: <a href="newsportal.php?s=$session[sessionhash]">Newsportal</a> imo)


Optional step '5':
Install FireFly's hack "Add Who's Online locations in Admin CP" and make an entry for your newsportal.php page. Will work like a charm. 


And you're done.
