<h3>FAQ</h3>

     You are allowed as many URLs as you want.  We run an UNLIMITED rotator.<br /><br />


<strong><em><u>What kind of sites are not allowed to be used in the rotator?</u></em></strong><br />
     You are not allowed to include any adult content, illegal content, or other rotators.  We do not let you use other rotators because we allow for an unlimited amount of sites, so you should not need to use them.  They also make your page load slower.<br /><br />

     Yes you can remove the advertisement for the low cost of $1.00 per month.<br /><br />


<strong><em><u>Why is my rotator displaying your site?</u></em></strong><br />
