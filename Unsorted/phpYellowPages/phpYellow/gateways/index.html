<h2>Choose a Processor</h2>
<h3>Payment Validation - How it works</h3>
<p>
Not all processors are created equal. Some are worse than others. Much worse. 
Payment gateway processors make banks look good. Beware of processors and carefully 
watch their billing to your account, and to your credit card too. 
</p>


<p>
<i>You know I actually read the entire agreement the last time the payment processor 
said they changed it. I have formal legal education from a university. Nowhere 
did I read that the processor was going to hit up my credit card instead of my 
positive online account balance. But they did hit up my credit card and took hundreds. 
Before that they completely missed a 4 week period of payment involving well over a thousand 
dollars US funds. Not even an apology. I'd never even have known they had missed two (2)  
payments (each covering a two week period and in theory automatically transferred into 
my account - yeah right...) if I didn't watch the account numbers like a hawk. And Customer Service 
was non existent - there wasn't even an 800 number that was usable and I racked 
up over USD$80 in one month of phone calls to the VP of Customer Service - just to get the money 
that I was paying them to collect for me. hmmmm. 

Did you check the fine print about 
chargebacks to your account? If you didn't it could cost you hundreds each month ... it's not 
the processor who you pay and who approves the transaction who is reponsible for it. You are! And 
if the transaction later goes sour guess who pays for the transaction that the processor 
approved ... YOU. That's not all, but perhaps that's enough to save you from the incompetent, insensitive, non-caring 
and fraudulent rip off artists that call themselves 
payment gateway processors. Buyer beware.
