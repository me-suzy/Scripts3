<h2>Payment Gateways</h2>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
<i>Payment gateway processors make banks look good. Beware of processors and carefully 
watch their billing to your account, and to your credit card too.</i> 
</p>

<h3>Payment Validation</h3>
<p>
For each payment method (except online payment by credit card) the customer 
is prompted to send in payment. You validate this payment according to your 
own business rules. You ensure the customer has actually made payment. 
For example, if payment by check is made, then you verify the check has 
cleared and that funds have been transferred into your bank account. 
</p>
<p>
For online credit card validation (which you may turn on or off) the customer 
payment is verified by your credit card processor. 
Separate documents detail how this is done. Each processor will have different 
ways of achieving the same goal - of making sure the credit card payment is valid. 
</p>


<h3>You choose the processor, DreamRiver can do the Integration</h3>
<p>
A Payment Gateway can be integrated for you by DreamRiver for a flat rate of $99 
for any major gateway integration. If you are examining what gateway is best, look at either:
</p>



<h3>Worldpay</h3>
<p>
Worldpay is a reputable firm. It is capable of giving you everything you need in 
an online processing environment - and even can offer you a slice of the action 
if you decide to buy into their partner program. Worldpay is also the ONLY firm 
capable of giving you true multi-currency capability.

<h3>Paypal</h3>
<p>
Paypal offers a much lower price to get started. Their system tends to be easy 
to use. If you just need a single function processor then perhaps paypal might work for you. If you have more 
than one product or service to sell then you may be better off with Worldpay 
who can give you a complete system with all the bells and whistles. Paypal is a good first 
payment processor because the total cash outlay you need to get started is low. And Paypal 
spares you the volumes of application documents that other processors insist on having.

<h3>Other Processors</h3>
<p>
There may be NO other processors worthy of consideration. (We have even received complaints 
about Paypal.) If you think there are, please let us know. If you have any questions feel free to ask!
