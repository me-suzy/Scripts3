<h2>Version 2.41 Released June 10, 2002</h2>

<p>This relatively minor upgrade was to make phpYellow Pages 
run more smoothly on Microsoft IIS Web server. Variables were 
accepted from $HTTP_POST_VARS['foo'] or initialized to NULL in many 
pages. phpYellow Pages error_reporting with E_ALL will result in very 
few E_NOTICE warnings. E_NOTICE should be turned off for production 
serving.
</p>




<h2>Version 2.40 Released June 8, 2002</h2>

<p>PHP version compatibility additions are the major change in this release. 
All php versions 4.04 or higher are supported, including the newer 4.2.0

is support for paid Basic listings in the Premium edition.

AND automatically close after POPUPTIMEOUT milliseconds. You may change POPUPTIMEOUT in util.php. 
Payment module and miscellaneous upgrades also exist in this version as detailed below:

</pre>


<h2>Version 2.20</h2>

<p>Version 2.20 is a MAJOR release with ALL files affected. Key changes include the introduction of browser detection in both the Standard and Premium versions. The browser detection is linked to serving different .css files for different browsers. More information is available in the online phpYellow Pages Developer's Guide. Also, a brand new installation script really makes installing a breeze - even faster than before! While all files are affected, following are some specific changes:
</p>


<pre>
File			Action
install.html       Wow! Load this file in your browser and your phpYellow installation is as easy as pie.
all page level     added browser detection via javascript with customizable css file invocations in yellow.js

SearchForm         line breaks dynamically expand to accomodate dynamic category numbers

buy.php	      added functionality for optional live phone connect or live web chat during customer purchase of a paid listing

</pre>




<h2>Version 2.11</h2>
<p>Version 2.11 contains very MINOR code upgrades, along with expanded 
documentation in the Developer's Guide.</p>


<h2>Version 2.10</h2>
<p>Version 2.10 is a MAJOR upgrade release for the Premium version. 
Key new features include Feature Listing! and NEW Index Every Search, 
along with an expanded payment module for Premium Paid Listings. More 
details are available on Dreamriver's Fatpipe Digital Download showcase. </p>

<p>
The free Standard version saw a couple of code upgrades to enhance 
cosmetic effect, along with one bug fix for a wrong file invocation - spotted 
and fixed earlier on the online forum by users :)
</p>



<h2>Version 2.04</h2>
<p>Version 2.04 contains a new tax module intended for use 
with the payment module.</p>




<h2>Version 2.03</h2>
<p>Version 2.03 marks the integration of <b>multiple database tables</b> into the standard version. 
Also, the front end is improved in the standard version with the addition 
of the new <b>Click By Category</b> feature.</p>

<p>An <b>installation file</b> also appears in version 2.03 which will help upgrade an old 
installation or swiftly implement a new installation. The same install.php file works 
for both Standard and Premium versions. This file should be deleted from the web server after use.</p>

<p>A minor upgrade in version 2.03 is implementation wide <b>support for local PC 
implementation</b>. A default localhost util-dist.php file is included. This 
enables you to run phpYellow Pages locally, on your own machine, if you also
have installed mysql, php and web server software, all freely available.</p> 

<p>This version uses <b>&quot;traditional&quot; php code</b>. NO classes or objects are used 
in this code. This makes it easier for developers, students and beginners to easily change the 
code to match your needs.</p>



<p>In general, any version upgrade should totally replace existing files, except 
of course for any database table data.</p>

<h2>The Shift at Version 2.0</h2>
<p>Version 2.0 marks a significant change in the features, options and code 
within phpYellow Pages. The version 2.0 PAID features are vastly exanded. 
This includes a payment system for premium listings, preview of new listings 
prior to publication, multi-category submissions per each listing, many more table 
fields and other significant structural and functional changes. An installation 
script does much of the installation for you, although some configuration and 
file transfer is required.</p>



<h2>Versions 1.2 and lower</h2>
The following changes were made to older versions of phpYellow Pages. They are included here for archive reasons - you shouldn't need them as you _should_ be running the latest version of the software.

<pre>
The following changes have been made to the download package at:

Version Change from 1.0 to 1.01

a) This version change fixed a results display problem with users searching phpYellow with Netscape browsers.
b) Minor cosmetic facelifts are included.
c) The fix for the delete bug as mentioned in the support forum is included.
d) Files affected: most files have been modified since the last version. A complete upgrade to the latest version is warranted. Complete this upgrade by ftping the newest files to your webserver.

NOTE: To avoid unnecessary work and to avoid overwriting your configuration util.php3 file, open it up and paste in this code block over the existing block:
// Web enabled version checking
define("PRODUCTNAME", "phpYellow"); // DO NOT CHANGE.
define("INSTALLVERSION", "1.01"); // DO NOT CHANGE.
// Reserved for Premium Yellow Service // DO NOT CHANGE.
// END OF CONSTANT DECLARATIONS

The only significant change to the util.php3 file is the version number, used in version checking. The current version number is 1.01 . This simple change in pasting the code block above saves you the time of rewriting the entire util.php3 configuration file on ftp upload. The remaining new files should, of course, also be uploaded.

It would make more sense if user could first login and then from the

> Thus the browser by default sets the web address to the root address from which the page resides, 
and this is why the web address is displayed incorrectly.  I believe, although not tested,
a test for url needs to be placed so only if url>0 does the hyperlink get presented. 
otherwise it just prints company name with no hyperlink. (if --else statement)

	<h2><a name="wishlist">WISH LIST</a></h2>
<pre>

1) User language(s):
a) for the beginning: German
b) later a selective multi lingual approach would be necessary (=
advertiser can place the same add in several languages  the internet search
user can choose his language to view the ads)
2) Privacy mail:
the advertiser can choose if he wishes to activate the privacy mail feature
3) Categories:
a) Each category needs the option for a different set of data fields
(i.e. automotive, jobs, insurance, business opportunities, real estate etc.)
to accommodate the different objectives for the offer
b) the search parameters in each should be accordingly different
4) Photos:
The advertiser should be able to choose if he wants to publish photos with
the advert and how many, which is important for the pricing
5) URL
the advertisers should decide if he wants to publish his URL, which is
important for pricing
6) Multiple ads:
advertiser wishes to place several adverts
a) possibility to import from a structured data sheet (.xls, etc.) or
text file (.txt, .doc, etc.)
b) import gateway to other internet programs i.e. Multiple Listing
Service with realtors
7) User help:
is there a possibility to write help texts for various functions
8) Payment - necessary are the following features
a) international Credit Card processing in multiple countries
b) automatic renewing charge function
c) export of data in order to submit charge orders to the bank
9) Various charge options:
a) distinction between private and commercial advertiser
b) charge plans
(1) general (default) charge plan
(2) option of predefined charge plans
(3) individual charge plan per customer
c) promotions i.e.
(1) every advert placed in June gets one month free of charge
(2) first three months free of charge
(3) place 2 adverts, third free etc.

========================


Have you created anything like directory listing program
that displays complete pages for each entry?


Also is it possible to

My dream is a search form searches everything by default with

> first and last names.  I continue to hope.

I would prefer that a search automatically searched all
the fields in the ad, not just company and description.


Can you custome make a copy of PHP-Yellowpages for me with a review this site feature and a 5 star, 
rate this site feature? if so can it be with a registration for visitors who then would place there 
comment and to be able to rate the site. as far as reviews...it would be e-mailed to the owner of 
the ad so that they can respond to the poster by e-mail. This feature should have cookies so that 
only one post per visitor. give the option of sending another image with a second ad, 


4. Add pager field

Editing:
1. Only display the one that you look for. This is a
special case. Normally, as a business owner, you only
own one or two businesses. However, when I do
database import, I have to assign them all to me.
Therefore I may own thousands of businesses and it
will be a long list to sort through. I have to go to
the back end, and edit it at the table level.

Interface:


3. Highlight the category that has new entries since
the last time (day/week)
4. Display the last time the business was updated (is
it in the lastupdate field of contact?)


Data model:
1. Add a field to records the business

Configuration:
1. business submittion should be on pending until
approved by administrator to prevent from bad entry.
It should be configurable when log in as admin.

Integration:




Is it possible to add more then
1 image to your "yellow page' script?

Ideally we would want to have paid listings
and a way for the client to make coupons
with your system..
like http://rlaj.com/scripts/bizdirectory/biz-dir.html


> 5.  Does it have business review feature?  I want user
> to be able to rate the company's service.


1) Create one function for updating feature listing in the ADMIN Option.

2) Create one table for register visitors (B2C) that want to receive emails campaign.

3) Create one function for sending emails campaign:
Visitors (B2C), Company (B2B).

4) user login cookies


	> What do you think about parsing data from a large yellow pages database like
    > Infousa?  Then adding the results after my results.  

> Offer during the installation process a list of (say 200) possible fields -
> with check box options - that the installer can select/deselect and then it
> writes the category list for them.  Just a thought.
> 
> Also, on the "wish list", I'd really LOVE to see sub-categories!

	Do you foresee a mass e-mail submit feature?? Would be great if the admin
could e-mail all non paying businesses, reminding them of premium options..

  I think it would be great to send out a reminder a
> week or so before ad expiration.

	
	
	subcategories
	possibility to change advertise.php3 and the fieldnames in the emails too?	
	email activation link for new listing submissions
	convert Premium version to Multilingual
	more separation between admin update from user update
	more gateway processor options

	user login cookies 
	database abstraction layer
