<br><br>


<b><a name="work">How does phpYellow Pages work?</a></b><br>
<i>phpYellow Pages displays yellow pages to visitors. The listings are added 
by visitors to <b>YOUR website</b>. The listings are unique for each website. The 
overall purpose of the yellow page directory may be customized by you. You may have 
just geographic data, or just industry specific listings, or a list of associations ... 
the variations are endless.</i>

<br><br>

<b><a name="run">What does phpYellow Pages need to run?</a></b><br>
<i>phpYellow Pages requires any web server running php4 with a mysql database. 
Both php4 and mysql are free to download. The Standard version of phpYellow Pages is also free. 
Basically you can have an online customized database directory for free, complete with administration scripts.

<p></p>

Ask your internet service (ISP) provider for a mySQL database to be setup for you. The price is small - about $25 one time labor setup fee. You also need to have php4.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com</a><br>
<a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">http://www.php.net</a><br>
<br><br>
When you have php4 and mySQL available on your internet account then you may install phpYellow Pages. The installation file guides you through this process:

<br><br>



<b><a name="maxlistings">What is the maximum number of listings?</a></b><br>
<i>You may have an unlimited number of listings. The largest number of records observed by the author was 
over 25,000 listings on a UK site. phpYellow Pages in theory should scale well with mysql to several 
hundred thousand ( 300,000+ ) records. Some developers run in excess of a million rows on mysql. This seems to require 
hardware and software optimization. It is possible, and has been done.</i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="multiple">Can an advertiser list in multiple categories?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes. The free version does not support multiple categories. The Premium paid version 
easily accepts many category listings from one visitor.</i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="languages">Is phpYellow Pages available in a language other than English?</a></b><br>
Yes. UNSUPPORTED free versions are downloadable for Italian, Russian, Spanish, German or French. 
These versions are NONSTANDARD and DO NOT INTEGRATE with the English Standard or English Premium versions. 
Nevertheless, these other language versions are contributed for the benefit of the internet 
community. <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/fatpipe/showcase.php?productnumber=8">Click here for more info.</a>


<br><br>


<b><a name="local">Can phpYellow Pages run on a local machine?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes. The author runs phpYellow development locally. Set the INSTALLPATH in util.php. Localhost is the default.</i>

<br><br>



<b><a name="installdocs">Do you have documentation for installation and how to install?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes. Documentation for installation is found in two places: the installation script called &quot;install.html&quot; and in the 
<a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/docs/DOCSindex.html" target="_blank">phpYellow Pages Developer's Guide</a>. The Guide is included in the free and paid distribution files and contains the most 
information about this topic.</i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="howlong">How long does it take to install?</a></b><br>
<i>An &quot;average&quot; php programmer can install phpYellow Pages in less than 20 minutes. An amateur should be able 
to install in about 40 minutes total. An installation file makes this quite easy. The installation file checks for 
php, checks for a mysql database and will automatically create new database tables and insert test records for you. 
Essentially all you need to do is to configure your util.php file, upload all files to your webserver and run the 
install program from your web server.</i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="installfee">Can Dreamriver install phpYellow Pages on my website, and if so what is the price and delivery?</a></b><br>
Yes, phpYellow Pages can be installed on your website for you. The flat rate is $49.95 additional for either a free or a Premium version. [A premium version MUST be purchased prior to installing it.] Here's how to take advantage of a Dreamriver install on your website:
<br><br>
Just send an email to <a href="mailto:phpYellow@dreamriver.com?subject=Installation Request">phpYellow@dreamriver.com</a> with: 
<ol>
<li>ftp domain name -> example: domain.com</li>
<li>ftp temporary username -> example: richard</li> 
<li>ftp temporary password -> example: dreamriver</li> 
<li>mySQL database name -> example: mydatabasename</li> 
<li>mySQL database username -> example: uniquename</li> 
<li>mySQL database password -> example: password</li> 
<li>mySQL database host server -> example: sql.domain.com</li> 
<li>location to place the install -> example: /htdocs/</li> 
</ol>

If you have purchased a Premium copy indicate if you want paid listings &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. Most installs can be performed within three (3) business days, not including weekends and not including statutory holidays.



<br><br>



<b><a name="categories">Can I use my own categories?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes! phpYellow Pages is designed to be customized - especially the categories. Refer to the 
phpYellow Pages Developer's Guide <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/docs/DOCScustomize.html">customization section</a> for more info.</i>

<br><br>

<b><a name="subcategories">Will phpYellow Pages show subcategories?</a></b><br>
<i>No. Subcategories are not supported. Instead, use the description field to precisely identify 
the listing. This field is indexed and is easily searched and listings are easily found with 
the included search tools.</i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="commercial">Can phpYellow Pages be used commercially?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes. The free version and the Premium version may be used commercially. <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/docs/DOCSlicense.html">See the license.</a> </i>

<br><br>

<b><a name="paidlistings">How can I make money with phpYellow Pages?</a></b><br>
<i>Optionally charge your customers for enhancing their listing. Give the listing a higher 
page position for a fixed amount of time. Show more information with a paid listing. These 
features are included with the Premium version, along with new Administration tools to 
manage these features manually, as well as automatically. <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/upgrade.php">
An included &quot;Go Premium&quot; page describes enhanced listings</a>. You can also 
try out the online demo and pretend to <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/docs/DOCScustomize.html#testpayment">
make a purchase using many payment methods.</a></i> 

<br><br>

<b><a name="gatewayprocessor">Can I use my own gateway payment processor with phpYellow Pages?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes. Dreamriver is currently offering integration with your gateway payment processor for a flat rate of 
USD $99 per processor. Here's how to take advantage of this time limited opportunity:</i>
<br><br>
To get started you will need to have:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/fatpipe/startBuy.php" target="_blank">a paid Premium version of phpYellow Pages</a> installed on your web server
<li>information about your processor and implementation
<li>backup any phpYellow files you have changed to a safe location NOT in the /phpYellow folder. An example is util.php, 
header.php and footer.php
</ul>

Just send an email 
to <a href="mailto:phpYellow@dreamriver.com?subject=Installation Request">phpYellow@dreamriver.com</a> with: 
<ol>
<li>ftp domain name -> example: domain.com 
<li>ftp temporary username -> example: richard 
<li>ftp temporary password -> example: dreamriver 
<li>gateway processor temporary login username
<li>gateway processor temporary login password
<li>gateway processor login URL
</ol>
DELIVERY<br>
Installation of the gateway for phpYellow Pages may take up to 3 weeks, depending on DreamRiver availability and 
complexity of your processing interface.

<br><br>

<b><a name="logos">Does phpYellow allow for the use of logos?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes, in the Premium paid version. A free multilingual version also contains 
support for images, but the two have different logic for implementing this feature. 
The Premium version shows the logo to the person who adds it, after the insert 
operation is performed. Thereafter, the logos are only shown for paid listings. 
Try out the online demo to <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/login.php">add your listing and logo.</a></i>

<br><br>



<b><a name="customize">How do I customize phpYellow Pages?</a></b><br>
<a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/docs/DOCScustomize.html">Go to the Customize page</a> in the phpYellow Pages Developer's Guide.

<br><br>


<b><a name="banneradsystem">Can a banner ad system be integrated?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes, banner systems like phpAds can be used with phpYellow Pages. In general, <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Ad_Management/">
use a banner system written in php</a> 
because it may be easier to make it work with phpYellow Pages.</i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="support">What support is offered?</a></b><br>
<i>Support via email is offered free of charge. For a limited time this applies to ANY user.
 Normally the telephone is not a good option because of other offsite demands. Send an 
 email to <a href="mailto:phpYellow@dreamriver.com?subject=Support Request - phpYellow Pages">phpYellow@dreamriver.com</a>.</i>

<br><br>



<b><a name="license">What is the software license?</a></b><br>
You may <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/docs/DOCSlicense.html" target="_blank">find the phpYellow Pages software license here.</a>

<br><br>



<b><a name="copyright">Can I remove all trace of copyright and ownership from phpYellow Pages?</a></b><br>
<i>If you have a good reason <a href="mailto:phpYellow@dreamriver.com">send your request to phpYellow@dreamriver.com.</a></i>

<br><br>


<b><a name="examples">Do you have example sites?</a></b><br>
<i>Yes. Dreamriver is sensitive to trial users spamming customer sites with fake phpYellow listings. Accordingly, 
such sites will not be listed here. Instead, use any major search engine and enter the search words &quot;phpYellow Pages&quot; 
and chances are you will see hundreds of different phpYellow Pages driven websites. You may 
<a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/phpYellow/">view the current demonstration site on Dreamriver</a>.</i> Here are some 
of the countries where phpYellow Pages Premium is used:

<b><a name="whyfree">What is the purpose of the freely downloadable Standard version?</a></b><br>
