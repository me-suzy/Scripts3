<h2><a name="regular">NEW REGULAR INSTALL ON A REMOTE WEB SERVER</a></h2>

<p>If the Quickstart failed to provide adequate directions then the 
following instructions are for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the instructions (this file)
<li>Go to your server and make a new directory called "phpYellow" without the quotes.
<li>upload all files to the directory
<li>Configuration
</ol>



<h2><a name="config">CONFIGURATION</a></h2>

<p>Open util-dist.php in a text editor (such as Notepad) and save it as util.php. Within util.php change all the // CONSTANT declarations starting near the top of the page. More configuration suggestions and examples are contained within the comment lines for each item. Do NOT change the name of the constants, but rather change the value of the data the constant will hold. For example, change the constant called WEBMASTER to be your email address:</p>

<p><code>
example: define("WEBMASTER", "webmaster@yourdomain.com" ); 
// change lower case letters only.
</code></p>


<p>Continue and change each constant to the value it should be in your circumstance. Upload this changed <b>util.php</b> file to your web server along with <b>testdb.php</b> and <b>install.php</b> and <b>yellow.css</b>. 

<i>In no case should any data be deleted; data will only need changing to another value. If unsure what values to change then ask your local internet service provider, or post your query to the support bulletin board at <a href="http://www.dreamriver.com/forums/">http://www.dreamriver.com/forums/</a></i>
</p>


<h2><a name="premiumconfig">Configuring Standard &amp; Premium Version CONSTANTS</a></h2>

<p>Following are descriptions of how to use some of the CONSTANTS defined 
in util.php</p>


<h3>FEATURELISTING</h3>

<p>Guaranteed top quality placement <b>on EVERY search page</b>. 
Your best possible listing position. Prospective customers are given 
your email address to make inquiries.</a></p>

<p>To change or set a Feature Listing you set a unique number. You 
may change it as often or as little as you like. You also set the price 
for this prime listing position. The listing really does appear with 
every search result! It can be worth a lot - and you decide how much 
to charge your customers for this.
</p> 
 
<p>
The CKEY field number is the unique number to change. It is shown 
with each search result, in gray at the bottom of each record. All 
you have to do is enter the ckey number in util.php next to the 
constant called FEATURELISTING, and upload util.php to your server.
The generation of the actual listing is all database driven - you just 
set the number, phpYellow Pages does the rest.
</p>




<h3>RECORDSPERPAGE</h3>

<p>The number of results per page in any search - modify if wanted. Generally 
you will want to set this number lower, for example at 10 records per page.
If you are using paid listings then the more records per page you allow the 
more first page listings you can have, and get paid for.</p>



<h3>QUEUELISTINGS</h3>
This constant tells phpYellow pages whether or not to send listings to a 
queue for administration approval. The default is &quot;no&quot;. A value 
of &quot;no&quot; will publish new or updated listinngs immediately. A value 
of &quot;yes&quot; will queue ALL new and updated records for administration 
preview and approval prior to publication. 

<p>To approve any listing, just go to admin.php and use the 
Preview Listings by Status tool. It automatically checks the database 
and reports status of listings. You can then point and click to set 
the status of any listing to pending, approved or expired. The 
main search seen by website visitors will only use approved listings in any search results.
</p>


The recommended value for QUEUELISTINGS is &quot;no&quot;. There are a 
number of reasons for such a preference:

<ul>
<li>a value of &quot;yes&quot; prevents listers from buying until you approve the listing</li>
<li>queued listings are more work, since you have to approve each and every queued item - 
including valid basic position listings which could be published right away</li>
<li>you can receive automatic notification of new listings</li>
<li>you can view the latest additions easily by viewing the &quot;New!&quot; page</li>
<li>you can easily remove any listing with the Manage-Listing tool</li>
</ul> 



<h3>PAIDLISTINGS</h3>

<p>In general you should be referring to the page about Paid Listings for 
comprehensive information about paid listings and phpYellow Pages.</p>

<p><a href="DOCSpaidListings.html">Refer to the Paid Listings docs.</a></p>


<p>Toggle paid listings on or off - "yes" will enable script processing, 
anything else will disable processing. Processing is linked to various 
payment methods. </p>




<h3>BYPASSCARDPROCESSOR</h3>
<p>This is used to test what happens to a paid listing 
without involving the gateway processor. This rechannels the processing
from an internal form to an internal script - it bypasses the card 
processor entirely. Normally you will want to go to the card processor - 
this feature is just for testing. Try it, but remember to change it back
to live mode. Set the value to &quot;no&quot; to include the card 
processor.</p>



<h2><a name="connect">DATABASE AND PHP CONNECTION</a></h2>

<p>Load install.html in your web browser and follow the directions.</p>


<hr>


<h2><a name="files">FILES - some of the more significant files</a></h2>

<pre>
FILE				PURPOSE
install.html	    // helps you install the entire application
admin.php           // login to your administration pages
easysql.php 		// no, you can't load it directly - it has to be secure from hacking
	     			// you can load easysql.php in a link within the admin.php page 			
index.php			// the start and search page the users see
login.php			// user add-edit-delete module
password.php		// the user attempts to find their password
admin.php			// administration only - internally phpYellow password protected
categories.php		// holds all the categories, individual items may be added, edited or removed
countries.php		// contains all the countries, individual items may be added, edited or removed 
upgrade.php         // Yellow Pages Premium - make $money, see POTENTIAL REVENUE.
</pre>





<h2><a name="bridge">CMS Bridge</a></h2>
<p>
Parts of Version 2.24 and higher versions incorporate CMS Bridge middleware. This is useful if 
you are using a Nuke software product and want to integrate your Nuke copy 
with the phpYellow Pages application. See <a href="http://portal.dbserve.net/codeshare/cms_bridge.htm">
http://portal.dbserve.net/codeshare/cms_bridge.htm</a>
for instructions and information. 
</p>




<h2>CUSTOMIZATION</h2>
<a href="DOCScustomize.html">Visit the customization page</a> and find out how to optimize your implementation.


<h2><a name="cash">POTENTIAL REVENUE</a></h2>

<p>Cash is good. Upgrade to a paid version and earn some by charging for the 
position of listings on YOUR pages. YOU set the rate you charge your customers. Premium phpYellow Pages  
lets you easily set the page position of any listing with a few mouse clicks, and comes with a wide 
range of new, feature rich benefits.
</p>

<p>Many more features are also available with the paid version. More features are constantly added - but 
mostly to the paid version only.
