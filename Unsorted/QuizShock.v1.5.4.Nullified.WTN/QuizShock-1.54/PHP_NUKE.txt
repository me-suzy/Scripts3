QuizShock PHP-Nuke Integration Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The new user module system introduced in QuizShock 1.2.0 allows
QuizShock to share user databases with other software. QuizShock
now comes pre-packaged with a PHP-Nuke 6.5 user module.

This module allows QuizShock to be directly integrated with your
PHP-Nuke user database. Currently it integrates in the following
ways:

 * Users are authenticated directly from your PHP-Nuke database, 
   giving all of your users access to QuizShock without having to 
   register again.

 * All links to registration on QuizShock go directly to your 
   PHP-Nuke registration script.

 * All links to user profiles go directly to the PHP-Nuke
   profile script for the user.

 * You can specify which PHP-Nuke user level has access to the 
   QuizShock control panel.

Setup is very simple using the QuizShock user module system. Perform 
the normal QuizShock installation as specified in README.txt, with 
the following in mind:

 1. Make sure to install QuizShock to the same MySQL database as
    PHP-Nuke is installed on. Don't worry - the tables won't
    overlap because all of QuizShock's tables start with "ts_".

 2. When editing config.inc.php, find the option $C_OPTS['USER_MODULE']
    Make sure it is set to "phpnuke_6_5" instead of "standard".

 3. Edit the file "inc/ts_user_phpnuke_6_5.inc.php". This is the 
    QuizShock user module for PHP-Nuke. Edit the first several 
    options as appropriate for your PHP-Nuke installation.

 4. After installing QuizShock and performing these steps, go to the
    URL where you did the installation. Near the top, the "Registered 
    Users" and "Newest User" fields should match those on your 
    PHP-Nuke installation.

 5. When logging into the control panel, use your PHP-Nuke 
    administrator username and password, or one for whatever group id 
    you gave access to QuizShock (you can set which group gets 
    access to the control panel by editing 
    "inc/ts_user_invboard.inc.php". Don't worry about the admin 
    password you set during QuizShock installation, it won't be used 
    since you will be using your PHP-Nuke user database.
