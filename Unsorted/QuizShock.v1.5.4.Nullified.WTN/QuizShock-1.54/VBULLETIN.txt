QuizShock vBulletin Integration Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The new user module system introduced in QuizShock 1.2.0 allows
QuizShock to share user databases with other software. QuizShock
now comes pre-packaged with a vBulletin user module.

This module allows QuizShock to be directly integrated with your
vBulletin user database. Currently it integrates in the following
ways:

 * Users are authenticated directly from your vBulletin database, 
   giving all of your users access to QuizShock without having to 
   register again.

 * All links to registration on QuizShock go directly to your 
   vBulletin registration script.

 * All links to user profiles go directly to the vBulletin profile 
   script for the user.

 * QuizShock recognizes vBulletin's cookies so users can stay logged 
   in.

 * You can specify which vBulletin user group id has access to the 
   QuizShock control panel.

 * Optionally, QuizShock can update the "last activity" time for a 
   vBulletin user if they are using QuizShock

Setup is very simple using the QuizShock user module system. Perform 
the normal QuizShock installation as specified in README.txt, with 
the following in mind:

 1. Make sure to install QuizShock to the same MySQL database as your
    vBulletin is installed on. Don't worry - the tables won't overlap 
    because all of QuizShock's tables start with "ts_".

 2. When editing config.inc.php, find the option $C_OPTS['USER_MODULE']
    Make sure it is set to "vbulletin" instead of "standard".

 3. Edit the file "inc/ts_user_vbulletin.inc.php". This is the 
    QuizShock user module for vBulletin. Edit the first several 
    options as appropriate for your vBulletin installation.

 4. After installing QuizShock and performing these steps, go to the
    URL where you did the installation. Near the top, the "Registered 
    Users" and "Newest User" fields should match those on your 
    vBulletin installation.

 5. When logging into the control panel, use your vBulletin 
    administrator username and password, or one for whatever group id 
    you gave access to QuizShock (you can set which group gets 
    access to the control panel by editing 
    "inc/ts_user_vbulletin.inc.php". Don't worry about the admin 
    password you set during QuizShock installation, it won't be used 
    since you will be using your vBulletin user database.
