1. Welcome
====================================================

1.1 About the Script
----------------------------------------------------
Realty Manager is a Listings Management program for Real Estate
web sites.  The program also provides an interface for website visitors to
browse and search realty listings and provides a powerful password protected
administration tool that can add, modify and delete realty listings and
listing images.

1.2 System Requirements
----------------------------------------------------
Realty Manager requires the following to run:

    * Perl v5.004+
    * Web Server (Unix or Windows)
    * CGI-BIN or access to execute cgi scripts

1.3 Software License
----------------------------------------------------
Please take the time to carefully read the license agreement included in this
package.  The license agreement details the terms and conditions of the
Software License for Realty Manager. Make sure you have read and
understand these terms and conditions before using the software. 

2. Installation
====================================================

2.1 Installation Instructions
----------------------------------------------------

1. Unzip the distribution archive on to your computer making sure to
   preserve the directory structure that is stored in the zip file.

2. Double check to make sure the path to Perl is set correctly on the
   first line of each .cgi script.

3. Create a directory named /rm/ on your web server and upload all
   files and directories there.  Be sure to upload image files
   (*.gif or *.jpg) in binary format and everything else in ascii format.

4. Make the following files executable:(757)
   /rm/exec/*.*

5. Make the following directories and files writeable:(777)
   /rm/data/
   /rm/data/*.*
   /rm/homepages/
   /rm/homepages/images/
   /rm/listings/
   /rm/listings/images/

   NOTES: You need to create the listings and homepages directories.
   If your installing the script in your /cgi-bin/ directory and you
   can't read files in /cgi-bin/rm/listings/ in your browser because
   of security restrictions on your server you will need to create the
   following directories somewhere else on your server and change the
   default paths in RM2 under Setup Options.

   /rm/homepages/
   /rm/homepages/images/
   /rm/listings/
   /rm/listings/images/

6. Run the installation program /rm/exec/install.cgi

6. Run the admin program /rm/exec/rm.cgi and login with the username
   "RM" and the password "welcome".

7. Go to the User Manager Login Accounts and create a superuser account
   for yourself and change the password on the (or erase) "RM" account.  

8. Setup the Homepage Database Fields and Listing Database Fields under
   Setup Options and customize your listing and homepage templates.

9. Start entering listings.


2.2 Modifying Templates
----------------------------------------------------
There are 6 main templates used by the program that can be 
customized to match the look and feel of your site.  These
files aren't displayed directly on your site but rather are
used as templates to "publish" additional files that are.

When editting these template files we recommend you use a 
text based HTML editor.  The templates use special tags
to define and insert information and using WYSIWYG HTML
editor can be problematic.

Each template has a number of variables or "placeholders"
that can be inserted to tell the program what information
to insert in the published page.  A placerholder looks like
this $name$, a word or series or letters and number surrounded
by two dollar signs.  Another way that placeholders are sometimes
displayed in the source code is by using a special tag so the
actual placeholder isn't visable when viewing the template, like this:
<!-- template insert : $name$ -->
After each template we will list the placeholders available on that page.

In addition, some templates use TemplateCells.  A template
cell is a block of HTML that can be displayed or not displayed.
An example of this is on the user homepage where if the user
has uploaded any images they will be displayed, otherwise some
"no image available" text is displayed in there place.  
TemplateCells are easy to spot and we'll list which ones are
available after each page.

2.3 Configuring Search Engine
----------------------------------------------------
In addition to modifying the look and feel of the templates you can also 
modify the way the search engine works by modifying the Search Page Template.
There are several different ways you can search a field.

RANGE SEARCHING
To search between a range of values create a pulldown for the mininum
and maximum values.  ie:  bedrooms [min] [max].  The name of the pulldown
should be set to the name of the field it is to be applied to with _min or
_max applied to the end.  ie: lfield3_min lfield3_max.

KEYWORD SEARCHING
To search for a keyword in a specific field number simply create a form field
and append "_keyword" to the end.  ie:  to search for a keyword in lfield6 setup
a text field named "lfield6_keyword".

EXACT MATCH SEARCHING
As keyword searching returns any records that contain that keyword, exact match
only returns record that match the query exactly.  This is best used to specify
exact criteria to match.  ie:  bedrooms: 3, MLS# 1235453, etc.  To search
for exact matches create a form field and append _match, ie: lfield6_match

SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC USER
You can create a pulldown with all the user names by using the placeholder
"userlist". You can search for a user or a user keyword with "user_keyword"
and "user_match" to match the user name or "user_num" to match the user
number.

SORT ORDER
You can specify a sort order for results to be returned in with
the following fields:
<input type="hidden" name="sort_order" value="14,abc,forward">
<input type="hidden" name="sort_order" value="14,123,reverse">
The first part of the value ("14") is the field number to sort by,
the second part is the type of sorting to do (abc for alphabetical,
123 for numerical) and the third part is the direction to sort in.

RESULTS PER PAGE
You can specify the results to be shown per page with the "perpage"
field like so:  <input type="hidden" name="perpage" value="10">

MARK NEW LISTINGS AS "NEW"
You can have new listings that have been created or updated in 
the last few days displayed in a "NEW" templatecell on the 
search results page by using "marknew" field:
<input type="hidden" name="marknew" value="2">
In this example, any listings created or updated in the last
2 days will be shown as new.

ONLY DISPLAY NEW LISTINGS
You can have the search engine only display recent listings
with the "shownew" field allowing users to check what new
listings have been added without going through the entire
database:  <input type="hidden" name="shownew" value="7">
In the above example only listings created or updated in the
last 7 days will be displayed.

Search form fields that have no value are ignored.  So when you create 
new fields for your search page the default value should be blank.  
ie:  value="".

2.4 Security Concerns
----------------------------------------------------
Since all the data used in the program is stored in data files it is important
to ensure that that data is not accessable to users via the web.  For example:
If your data files are stored in /rm/data/ it is important to ensure that users
are unable to view or download those data files by typing the URL of the data 
directory and a data file into their browser.  In most cases your web server can
be configured to disallow this.  Talk to your Server Administrator for more
information.

In addition to protecting data files it is important to be aware of file
permissions.  When giving writen permission to data and other files it is
important to ensure that you are not allowing other users that may have
accounts on the web server access to your files.  In some cases where a
single web server hosts many websites and users, one user may be able to read
or write another users files if file permissions are setup incorrectly.

If you are concerned about security and would like more information, contact
your server administrator.
