      <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Support Services Manager ("SSM") is a powerful Support Desk and Knowledge Base application.  It includes many powerful features to allow you to easily add a full-featured Knowledge Base along with a robust support request or "trouble ticket" management system to your existing support services.  Through SSM, you will be able to easily manage these effective systems and reduce the time and effort required in providing award-winning technical support.  In addition, certain versions of SSM allow you to integrate your Knowledge Base, Support Desk, and Web Community into one single sign-on environment, creating an easy, beneficial system to your users.  This level of integration is only possible with SSM or expensive custom development work, making SSM very cost-effective.  We hope that you find SSM to be a worthwhile addition to your online network.</P></FONT>

<P><STRONG>BEFORE INSTALLING</STRONG> </P>
<P>Please adhere to the following guideline BEFORE installing SSM:</P>
   					<OL>
   						<OL>
   							<LI>Please make sure that the web server which you will 
    be running SSM on is capable of handling PHP applications requiring MySQL 
    support. 
 
   							<LI>Make sure that you have an FTP client with which to 
    transfer files to your web server and a text editor with which to edit the 
    required files. 
 
   							<LI>Please read all enclosed documentation before installing SSM.</LI>
   						</OL>
   					</OL>
<P><STRONG>INSTALLATION</STRONG></P>
<P>The Installation process:</P>
   					<OL>
   						<OL>
   							<LI>Extract the archive file, which you downloaded from 
    the web. We recommend that you use the default file/folder locations. 
 
   							<LI>Upload these files to your web server. Please make 
    sure that you upload PHP/HTML/TXT files in ASCII format and Image files in 
    BINARY format in your FTP client. In most cases selecting the Auto format 
    should also accomplish the same thing. 
 
   							<LI>CHMOD db.php so that it can be written to by the web 
    server. 
 
   							<LI>Use your browser and navigate to the folder in which 
    you installed SSM into on your web server. Then select the subfolder 
    install. From this folder, please run setup.php . Follow the on-screen 
    prompts to setup and install the software and supporting database tables. 
 
   							<LI>After you have completed all steps as directed by 
    Setup, remove the install directory and all of the files that it contains. 
 
   							<LI>SSM is now able to run on your server.  Please see below for a set of suggested guidelines before making SSM public.</LI>
   						</OL>
   					</OL>
<P><STRONG>SETTING UP SSM</STRONG>  </P>
<P>Tasks to accomplish before making your installation of SSM a public application for your site:</P>
   					<OL>
   						<OL>
   							<LI>You should add subjects through the administration 
    area. These help describe the contents of any submitted support requests 
    ("tickets") and also serve as the categories for articles in the Knowledge 
    Base. 
 
   							<LI>It is suggested that you take time to add some 
    useful articles to your Knowledge Base. Building the KB as a resource will 
    help reduce the load on your support staff over time as users use the KB to 
    help themselves. Therefore, should you find a question that is submitted 
    frequently, add the answer to your KB as an article. 
 
   							<LI>Should you wish to make SSM fit into your existing site design, you can also take some time at this stage to customize the appearance of it.  Two color variables have been included in the setup stage with the default values entered.  These can be changed in the administration area.  Should you need assistance customizing your copy of SSM, please post in our</FONT><A HREF="http://net.sheddtech.com/forums/">
   						      						   <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>support community</FONT>
</A>   						   
   						   <FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>. It is beyond the scope 
    of these documents to provide a complete guide to customizing SSM here. 
    Unfortunately, templates are not a feature which have been included in the 
    present release. They will be included in a future release, though so watch 
    the update notification box in the administration area. News of any updates 
    or patches will be shown there. 
 
   							<LI>You are now ready to make your copy of SSM public.  We hope that you find SSM to be a useful addition to your support resources.  If this is the case, we ask that you please read our list of small requests, which are included below.</LI></OL></OL>

<P>We feel that in most cases, SSM is a self-explanatory system.  We have included detailed explanations in most administrator features and the client side system includes clearly labeled functions.  We are at the present time developing additional Help documentation, so no detailed Help files are included at the present time.  Should you find a feature of SSM that you need explained, please contact us as described in this documents Getting Help section and well be more than happy to assist you.</P>
