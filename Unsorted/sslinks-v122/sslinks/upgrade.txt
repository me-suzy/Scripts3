Upgrading from ssLinks v1.1
===========================

There are several stages involved in succesfully upgrading from ssLinks
v1.1 to ssLinks v1.22.  Firstly you should be aware of the brand new 
template system.  Virtually all HTML output by the script can now be
controlled using templates - these are stored by default in the 
templates directory.

The header and footer files can still be controlled using the header.html
and footer.html files found in the sslinks base directory.  As before, 
these files can include PHP if you set the $template_php variable to true.

Once you have edited global.inc.php to contain your database details you
should upload everything from the sslinks archive including the full
templates directory to your web server.  Before you can use the script you
need to make a slight modification to the database table structure used
by ssLinks v1.1.  To do this run the upgrade.php script.  The script will
ask for your database details, and will then alter the sslinkcats table
to make it compatible with ssLinks v1.22.  This will not affect any of your
data.

Upgrading to v1.22 from v1.2 or v1.21
=====================================

The differences between these versions are very small, but significant for some
users.  In particular v1.22 fixes the Top Rated SQL error bug experienced by 
anyone using MySQL 3.22 or earlier.

The following files from v1.2 should be replaced with updated files from the
v1.22 archive:

* footer_menu.tmpl      (updated version number)
* confirm_catdel.tmpl   (removed rogue \n"; code)
* global.inc.php        (updated login function and top_rated)

In addition the following file has been added to the archive in between v1.2
and v1.21:

* login_form.tmpl
