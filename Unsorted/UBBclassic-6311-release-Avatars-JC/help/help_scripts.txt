Test Scripts:

pathto.asp       - for Windows IIS servers

hello.cgi	 - these hello scripts will confirm that Perl is working
hello.pl

ubb6_test.cgi	 - this script helps test your permissions

#################################################
USING THE TEST SCRIPTS
#################################################

hello.cgi
hello.pl

Make sure your directory is set to execute scripts.

Upload this script in ASCII mode to your CGI directory.

On a UNIX/Linux server, chmod (change permissions) for the scripts to 755

Call the script from your browser:
http://yourdomain/yourcgi/hello.cgi
or
http://yourdomain/yourcgi/hello.pl

Check that the script says 'hello' and returns a Perl version of 5 or better.
Test both hello.cgi and hello.pl.


Troubleshooting the 'hello' scripts:

Only Text appears:  This means your server is not executing the script.  Check your ISP documentation for help.  Be sure your script is in the location the ISP requires.

On Unix/Linux servers this may mean you have not set the permissions to 755.

500 Server error:
a) You did not upload in ASCII
b) The top line does not point to Perl 5. Try #!/usr/bin/perl5
c) Perl is not installed or the server is not correctly configured.
d) If you unzipped ubbtools on a Linux or Unix machine, did you use the unzip -a switch to force an ASCII unzipping?

#################################################


ubb6_test.cgi

This script will test basic paths and permissions and suggest help for you.

Do NOT use this script unless the 'hello' scripts above work correctly.

Upload this script in ASCII mode to your CGI directory.

On a UNIX/Linux server, chmod (change permissions) for the scripts to 755.

Call the script from your browser:
http://yourdomain/yourcgi/ubb6_test.cgi

The script will attempt to enter an absolute path in the text box. If it does not you will have to enter one accurately.  Servers using perlis.dll and Netscape Servers may not automatically find the path.

You can use the pathto.asp on any Windows IIS server to tell you the absolute path to your directory or, in some cases, to your web root.

You may have to ask the ISP for the full path to your directories.  This is a common question they can answer easily.


TESTS: Checkboxes 1-4:

1) The first test will try to read, write, delete in the directory listed in the text box at the top.  Manually edit in a path to test if needed. (e.g.,  C:/Inetpub/yourdir/ubb  or /usr/home/wwwroot/yourdir/Members)

2) The second test will look for all required UBB.classic files either in the CGI directory or in the directory you specify.

3) The third test will test permissions of your variables files *only* if they are installed in the directory you are testing.

4) *IF* your UBB.classic is already configured you can test the accuracy of the paths by selecting this option.


TROUBLESHOOTING

Internal Server Error 500.  If the basic hello scripts work, this means that Perl 5 or its standard modules are not installed.

Blank Screen and no response.  Application Mappings are incorrect.

Script outputs its text and not results:  You server is not set to handle .cgi scripts properly or your Web provider does not allow CGI scripts.
