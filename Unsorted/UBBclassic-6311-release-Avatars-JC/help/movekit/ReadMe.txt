This is an **unsupported** script.
Do not use it unless you are familiar with basic Perl and editing skills.

These three scripts are named Ultimate.cgi, ultimatebb.cgi, and forumdisplay.cgi.

When you have transferred your old UBB.classic to a new site you may use these
scripts to redirect users to the new location.

1) Open each script in a text editor
2) Confirm the top line points to Perl5 on your server.
3) Edit in your new UBB.classic URL in the value called $newurl
4) Save the file and upload it to your **old** site in ASCII
5) This overwrites the copies of these three files on your server.
6) Test by calling the old UBB.classic URL in your browser.
