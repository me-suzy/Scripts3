UBB.classic(tm) Licensed Version

Thanks for choosing Infopop's UBB.classic(tm) software!  After you have unzipped the file, you should see five folders called cgi-bin, help, Members, noncgi and variables.

STEP 1

If you do NOT see these folders, set your unzipping software to 'preserve directories' and start over.  Do NOT try to install the UBB.classic(tm) software by guessing at the file names and locations.

STEP 2

Paste this link into your browser: http://www.infopop.com/support/ubbclassic/install.html and print out the INSTALLATION instructions.  Be sure to choose the instructions that match your server [Unix/Linux or Windows/NT].

NOTE: If you are upgrading an existing licensed board, you need to download the "upgrade" release zip from the Member Area.  This is a full installation zip, which is only suitable for new installations or upgrades from the UBB.classic(tm) Trial Version.

STEP 3

Follow each step in the instructions, carefully and in order.  Ask for help from a friend or your hosting provider if you are unsure.


DIAGNOSTIC SCRIPTS

In the help folder, you'll see several scripts that can help you with your installation.  They are referenced within the installation instructions where they might be appropriately used, along with instructions for their use.

CAUTIONS

Do not leave pathto.asp or ubb6_test.cgi on your server. Delete them from the server when you are done. Leaving them in place poses a security risk.
