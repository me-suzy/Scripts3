This readme file is intended to help you set up the Shout It Out.
Check if all the files are present:
- readme.txt (this file)
- shout.php
- mysql.txt
- connect.php

First upload shout.php to the root of the webfolder - so that it is accesible this way:
- http://www.yourDomain.com/shout.php
Then upload the icons to a directory similar to this:
- http://www.yourDomain.com/images/shout/

Now use phpMyAdmin, if installed on your server, to make the tables in the MySQL databse.
The descriptions are available in the mysql.txt file.

It contains both the table for the Shout.php and a table for bad word checking (censuring).

In the top of shout.php there is a reference to stylesheet.css - just use your own css.

Thats all - hope it works out for you!
