Before you can use Rayserve you need to create the program Configuration File, a Start Page and a Data File for your online reservation system. These utilities are provided to help with this process. You can also customise help messages and the &quot;look and feel&quot; of your pages.
<P></P>
The user manual explains configuration file settings, creation of a Start Page, and the use of these utilities. If you have not already done so read the manual now.
<H2>Configuration</H2>
This file sets the basic parameters for Rayserve operation and the way in which it will connect to a secure server or secure payment gateway.
<H2>Message Creator</H2>
You can customise the help, information and error messages displayed by Rayserve by creating a new message file, or modifying the default messages. Before you begin use the <A HREF="javascript:parent.newWin('HelpViewer.html','Messages',550,500,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0);">Message Viewer</A> to display the default messages.
<H2>Style Creator</H2>
A style sheet controls the way your pages are displayed by the visitors browser. You can change font style, size, colour, background colour, and the colours used to display the booking confirmation page and other pages in your site. Before you begin use the <A HREF="javascript:parent.newWin('StyleViewer.html','Styles',550,500,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0);">Style Viewer</A> to display the default page styles.
<H2>Page Writer</H2>
This is used to create a page that loads Rayserve into the guests browser. You can create your site using frames or if you do not like the look of fames you can use the &quot;frameless&quot; option.

You can create pages from scratch with any HTML editor. However, using Page Writer ensures that the correct program syntax is used. You can, of course, use your normal HTML editor to modify pages after they have been created with Page Writer.
