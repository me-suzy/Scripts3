<H1 ALIGN="center">About Rayserve - Standard Version</H1>
Rayserve is a program that can be used to take bookings for hotels, guest houses or apartments over the Internet. The program calculates the cost of each stay based on information you enter into the program configuration and data files. It can also check to see if the rooms requested are available and automatically update the data file if the visitor decides to make a reservation.
<P>
In the booking form you can specify any number of options that a visitor can included with the room (meals or airport pickup for example). Each option can either increase or decrease the room price.
<P>
Below is a list of the main program features and configuration options. <A HREF="#feats">Features</A> and configuration options shown in red can be turned on or off.
<P>
Rayserve is pre-configured to connect to any one of 17 different <A HREF="#paysys">secure payment systems</A>. In addition there is a custom setting and an add-on module called <A HREF="#sfinf">Transaction Manager</A> that can be used to record credit card transaction data.

<TR><TD CLASS="detail4">
Transaction Manager is an add-on module for Rayserve that can be used on your own secure server or that of your ISP. Rayserve sends data to Transaction Manager which then displays a form where the visitors enter their credit card details. Data sent by Rayserve (guests name, address, booking reference, amount of deposit etc.) is automatically inserted into this form. Transaction data is recorded on the secure server and can be retrieved using a web browser after logging on to Transaction Manager.
<P>
Transaction Manager uses one way encryption for the password(s) used to retreive transaction data. All data stored on the server is encrypted for added security.
