SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


The script was tested on 21stcenturyhost.net's virtual servers
(http://www.21stcenturyhost.net). In order to run the script,
the following is required:
- UNIX-based server (script was not tested on Win NT/2000);
- Perl 5 or later;
- Capability to execute Perl scripts and set permissions on the server;
- UNIX sendmail for sending e-mail.



INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


*************************************************************************************
* Upgrade from the previous freeware versions is not supported in this release.     *
*************************************************************************************
* Before proceeding with the installation, check that the path to the perl          *
* interpreter is correct at the top of every .cgi file. The default #!/usr/bin/perl *
* will work for most servers.                                                       *
*************************************************************************************


1. Unzip all the script files to a temporary directory.


2. Choose or create a directory on your server where you want to install the script
(e.g. "/cgi-bin/rankmaster"). Set up the permissions on the created directory as shown below:

CHMOD 755 rankmaster


3. Make another 4 directories within your script directory: "/flags", "/html", "/members", and "/templates".
Your directory tree should look something like this:

/cgi-bin
----/rankmaster
--------/flags
--------/html
--------/members
--------/templates

***This directory structure is recommended but is not required. You can place the above directories
anywhere on your server.***


4. Set up the permissions on your directories as shown below:

CHMOD 755 flags
CHMOD 755 html
CHMOD 777 members
CHMOD 777 templates


5. Upload the contents of the supplied "flags" folder to your "/flags" directory created in step 3.
***Note that all image files must be uploaded in BINARY mode. You may have to move the "/flags" directory
outside your cgi-bin if your host does not allow images to be displayed under cgi-bin directory.***


6. Upload the contents of the supplied "html" folder to your "/html" directory created in step 3.
***Note that all image files must be uploaded in BINARY mode. You may have to move the "/html" directory
outside your cgi-bin if your host does not allow images to be displayed under cgi-bin directory.***


7. Upload the contents of the supplied "members" folder to your "/members" directory created in step 3. Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 count.log
CHMOD 777 ip.log
CHMOD 777 lastupdate.log
CHMOD 777 timer.log
CHMOD 777 memblist.cgi

***All log and cgi files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


8. Upload the contents of the supplied "templates" folder to your "/templates" directory created in step 3. Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 common.txt
CHMOD 777 foot.txt
CHMOD 777 head.txt
CHMOD 777 errors.tmpl
CHMOD 777 index.tmpl
CHMOD 777 membarea.tmpl
CHMOD 777 memblogin.tmpl
CHMOD 777 rateform.tmpl
CHMOD 777 regform.tmpl
CHMOD 777 regterms.tmpl
CHMOD 777 success.tmpl

***All template files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


9. Upload the program files to the script directory created in step 2 (e.g. "cgi-bin/rankmaster"). Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 common.sub
CHMOD 777 memb.sub
CHMOD 777 templates.sub
CHMOD 777 variables.sub

CHMOD 755 admin.cgi
CHMOD 755 adminpass.cgi
CHMOD 755 index.cgi
CHMOD 755 ipreset.cgi
CHMOD 755 members.cgi
CHMOD 755 rate.cgi
CHMOD 755 redirect.cgi
CHMOD 755 reset.cgi
CHMOD 755 settings.cgi
CHMOD 755 update.cgi

***All program files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


10. Type in the URL of your admin.cgi file in your browser location window (e.g. "http://www.mywebsite.com/cgi-bin/rankmaster/admin.cgi").


9. The default administrative password is admin - it will be set the first time you run the admin.cgi script.
You can change it later by selecting the "Change Administrative Password" option on the RankMaster Admin Screen. Click
the "Continue to Administrative Area" link.


10. Now click the "Configure Script Variables" option on the RankMaster Admin Screen and adjust the script variables as required.
Check the "Update Now!" and "Reset Now!" boxes to set the current times for "Last Update" and "Next Reset Dates". Save your variables.


11. You are should be all done by now. Hit the "RELOAD" button on your browser to reload the Admin Menu page and then click "My RankMaster"
link to view your Top List. Try registering a site and voting for it to make sure everything works properly. Have fun!
