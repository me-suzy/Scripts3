=========== = first use of wa-boo v 0.8.5 = =============   


   You can now use the application. The only usable account after this init 
   stage is a "godlike" account (can do everything). the login is "godlike" 
   and the password is "godlike".
   
   The first thing to do is to log as godlike and to modify your rights (to 
   access this administration mode, pleas check the admin check box on login 
   page). Beacuse this user can do everything, he can create both groups and 
   users.
   
   User and admin help are not yet translated in english
