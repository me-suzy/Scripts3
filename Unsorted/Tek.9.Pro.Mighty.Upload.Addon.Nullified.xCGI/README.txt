MightyUp

MightyUp is an ActiveX control that allows you to have a user upload any kind of file 
and save it on the server.  It's perfect for ad submission engines, or website 
management scripts, because it eliminates a need to train users on complex FTP 
operations, or to send emails with attachments that then have to be managed further.  
It's got documentation included, and a sample source file that demonstrates using it.

Press CTRL-R in the registration program (see your Start menu) if it 
doesn't let you enter a code in.

Just expand the .zip file, run the setup, and your done!



NOTE: If you are unable to use this MightyUp object, and you want to have web-based 
file-upload abilities, then:
A) then the server MUST allow the IUSR_machinename account to have at least 
read/write permissions to the /img/ directory and its subdirectories, AND the 
/ssl/img/ must also be able to be written to via the IUSR_machinename account. 
Those 2 directories are the ones written to via your uploading.
B) IE5 or higher must also be installed on the server. Why? Because we use native 
Windows components to handle the file uploading procedure, so that you don't have 
to install proprietary objects!

If you are unable to run MightyUp, IE5+, or set permissions at the server, then you 
will have to manually upload your files via FTP. What a pain!


MightyUp is an extremely small object. VERY fast running. Rock-solid. Proven.
