		<span class='headline'>About</span><br/><br/>
		Instant Web Mail is a free, web-based POP mail client. It is incredibly
		easy to install - however, the easy installation comes at a price:
		There are no <i>Sent mail</i> and <i>Trash</i> folders, and there is no
		address book.<br/>

		</ul>
		<br/><br/><br/><br/>



		<a name='requirements'></a><span class='headline'>Requirements</span>
		<ul>
			<li>A web host account or server with
			<a href='http://php.net/'>PHP</a> 4.0.3 or a later
			version. You do <b>not</b> need IMAP support in PHP -
			a standard installation of PHP will work.</li>

			<li>A contemporary browser with extensive support for
			JavaScript and CSS. Netscape Communicator/Navigator 4.x and
			Internet Explorer 4.x will not work. Instant Web Mail has
			been known to work in
			<a href='http://www.konqueror.org/'>Konqueror</a>,
			<a href='http://mozilla.org/'>Mozilla</a>,
			<a href='http://opera.no/'>Opera</a>, and newer versions of
			Netscape and Internet Explorer.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/><br/><br/><br/>



		<span class='headline'>Download</span><br/><br/>
		<a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50699'>Download
		Instant Web Mail</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>



		<span class='headline'>Install</span>
		<ol>
			<li>Upload the entire instantwebmail directory to your server.
			That's it! Instant Web Mail works right out of the box (hence
			the name), so if you want to try it out right away, point your
			browser to http://example.com/instantwebmail/index.php and log in.
			However, if you want to change the language or other
			configuration options, you should follow the next steps:</li>

			<li>If you've installed the program on a Unix server (e.g. Linux,
			FreeBSD, or Sun Solaris), you need to chmod (change the permissions of) the file
			settingssaved.php to 666. This can usually be done from within
			your FTP client. Right-click on settingssaved.php, select "Chmod",
			and check the boxes as shown on this picture:<br/>
			<img src='images/chmod.png' height='238' width='347' alt='Chmod'/>
			</li>

			<li>Point your browser to
			http://example.com/instantwebmail/settings.php. Log in with the
			username "username" and the password "password". Now you can
			configure Instant Web Mail to suit your needs. <b>Don't forget
			to change the administrator username and password right
			away</b>.</li>
		</ol>

		<a name='questionsAndAnswers'></a><span class='headline'>Questions and answers</span><br/><br/>

		If your question is not answered here, please visit the
		<a href='http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=50699'>forums</a>.<br/><br/>

		<b>Why do I get an "Internal Server Error" message when I load
		the pages?</b><br/>
		Delete the file named ".htaccess" - that should get rid of
		the error message. However, be aware that if you delete the
		.htaccess file <b>and</b> your web host has enabled
		<a href='http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.php'>magic_quotes_*</a>,
		you might experience problems with backslashes being added to
		the emails you write (i.e., all quotation marks will have a
		backslash in front of them). In that case there's nothing you
		can do but ask your web host to disable magic_quotes_*.
		<br/><br/>

		<b>I get warnings or error messages when I try to send messages
		with attachments.</b><br/>
		When you attach a file, you're actually uploading a file
		to the server. This file needs to be written to the hard disk
		of the server, and if PHP cannot copy the file to the disk, it
		issues an error message. The situations in which PHP is unable
		to write to the disk are usually caused by an erroneous PHP
		setup or wrong permissions on the upload directory. This means
		that you need to contact your web host and make them fix the
		problem. Make sure you include the entire error message and
		other relevant information.<br/><br/>

		<b>Why do I get an error message saying that the function wordwrap()/is_uploaded_file()/session_unset()
		is undefined?</b><br/>
		Probably because you didn't read this readme file thoroughly. It is
		very clearly stated in the <a href='#requirements'>Requirements</a>
		section which version of PHP is needed to run Instant Web Mail. You
		need that version (or a newer one), otherwise the whole thing won't
		work. That should go without saying - nevertheless, I get a lot of
		emails asking me the above question. If you don't know which version of
		PHP is installed on your server, ask your web host, or try running this
		script:<br/><br/>
		&lt;?php<br/>
		echo "You are using PHP version ".PHP_VERSION;<br/>
		?&gt;
		<br/><br/>

		<b>Why does it take more than 10 seconds for each page to load even
		though I have a fast Internet connection?</b><br/>
		The problem is probably caused by the POP server. Some POP servers
		perform so-called reverse DNS lookups on the clients that connect to
		them. These reverse DNS lookups take time - often more than 10 seconds.
		If the POP server is located within your internal network (LAN), you
		can probably eliminate the problem by using the IP address of the
		server instead of the host name when you log in. Another solution is of
		course to ask your system administrator to disable reverse DNS lookups
		in the POP server.<br/><br/>

		<b>The program can't connect to the POP server even though I'm entering
		the correct host name, username, and password.</b><br/>
		This might be a firewall issue. Some web hosts that offer their
		services for free shut off all network traffic from/to certain ports.
		There's nothing you can do but install Instant Web Mail on
		another server.<br/><br/>

		<b>How can I be informed about new releases of Instant Web
		Mail?</b><br/>
		Go to <a href='http://freshmeat.net/'>freshmeat</a>, create a new
		user account if you don't have one already, find
		<a href='http://freshmeat.net/projects/instantwebmail/'>the project page
		for Instant Web Mail</a>, and click on "Subscribe to new releases".
		<br/><br/><br/><br/>



		<span class='headline'>To do</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Instant Web Mail should be rewritten to take advantage
			of the new, global arrays $_GET, $_POST, and $_REQUEST.
			That way, the program would also work on systems where
			register_globals is off.</li>

			<li>Better handling of multipart/related messages.</li>

			<li>Bug: The decoding of 7-bit headers cuts away spaces in rare
			cases. E.g. the subject line
			"Tester =?iso-8859-1?b?xiwg2CBvZw==?= =?iso-8859-1?b?xQ==?="
			will incorrectly be displayed as "Tester &AElig;, &Oslash; og&Aring;". The space
			between "og" and "&Aring;" has been cut away for some reason.</li>

			<li>Bug: Incorrect parsing of headers that extend to more than one lines. Say
			the subject looks like this in the message source:<br/><br/>

			Subject: All your base<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are belong to us.<br/><br/>

			Instant Web Mail will display that subject line as just "All
			your base".<br/><br/>

			It's important to note that Instant Web Mail does not have any
			problems parsing those multi-line headers that provide
			information about the content type, character set, etc. of a
			certain message part. That is, Instant Web Mail will parse
			headers like the following correctly:<br/><br/>

			Content-Type: multipart/mixed;<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boundary="----asdf1234"</li>
		</ul>
		<br/><br/><br/><br/>



		<a name='changeLog'></a><span class='headline'>Change log</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Version 0.61 (April 9, 2002)
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a security bug that in some cases allowed
				people to take over other people's sessions.</li>

				<li>The <a href='#questionsAndAnswers'>Questions and
				answers</a> section was updated.</li>

				<li>The .htaccess file containing directives to disable
				magic_quotes_* is back. It seems to be the easiest way
				to avoid problems with backslashes. See the
				<a href='#questionsAndAnswers'>Questions and
				answers</a> section for information about what to do if
				the .htaccess file causes an "Internal Server Error"
				message.</li>

				<li>Instant Web Mail development moved from
				<a href='http://understroem.dk/'>Understrøm</a> to
				<a href='http://sourceforge.net/'>SourceForge</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.60 (March 17, 2002)
			<ul>
				<li>The user may now choose his/her preferred language when
				logging in. The default language is the language specified by
				the administrator.</li>

				<li>Capitalized headers such as "SUBJECT" and "FROM" are now
				recognized.</li>

				<li>Instant Web Mail now uses PHP's built-in error
				handling system.</li>

				<li>For security reasons it is no longer possible to write
				extra headers besides the normal ones when composing
				messages.</li>

				<li>I've given up on magic_quotes_gpc : ) This means I will no
				longer write additional code to remove slashes that were added
				automatically by the PHP parser. If magic_quotes_gpc is enabled
				on your server... tough luck!</li>

				<li>New theme: "Chatvillage".</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.59 (March 10, 2002)
			<ul>
				<li>Some corrections were made in the Italian language file.</li>

				<li>The German language file was corrected once again.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.58 (February 3, 2002)
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a couple of wrong default settings in
				settingsSaved.php.</li>

				<li>Removed the border around images.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.57 (January 28, 2002)
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a bug that caused the preset server names, usernames,
				etc. to be displayed as "A" on systems where magic_quotes_gpc
				is on. The same bug was also the cause of a "foreach" error
				that occured when you edited settings.php.</li>

				<li>New Croatian translation.</li>

				<li>More corrections in the German language file.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.56 (January 22, 2002)
			<ul>
				<li>The annoying problems with magic_quotes_gpc were fixed. In
				earlier versions of Instant Web Mail, I tried to turn
				magic quotes off by including a .htaccess file that contained
				the following command: "php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off". However,
				that only worked in some instances. In a lot of cases, the
				command either didn't work at all, or it caused an "Internal
				Server Error" message. I decided to remove the .htaccess file
				and write some code at the top of functions.php that handles
				the magic quotes issues.</li>

				<li>New theme: "Grand Issue".</li>

				<li>A minor error in the German language file was
				corrected.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.55 (November 13, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>The German translation was updated.</li>

				<li>The Spanish translation was updated.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.54 (October 26, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>New Icelandic translation.</li>

				<li>The Italian translation was updated.</li>

				<li>The Turkish translation was updated.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.53 (October 9, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>A new Slovak translation that replaces the old
				one.</li>

				<li>New Czech translation.</li>

				<li>Most other translations were updated.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.52 (September 30, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>Removed the crypt() function from settings.php
				because it caused problems with people not being able
				to log in.</li>

				<li>Added the .lowCheckBox class to the style sheets in
				order to insure that the check boxes in the header list
				don't take up so much space that they enlarge the
				subject table rows.</li>

				<li>New Slovak translation.</li>

				<li>Updated the Norwegian translation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.51 (September 23, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>Some people were unable to log in using the default
				username and password. I think I solved the problem. If
				some if you still can't log in, contact me, and I'll
				take another look at the problem.</li>

				<li>In order to make it clearer to the user which links
				are attachments, a tiny image is now displayed next to
				all attachment links.</li>

				<li>Added a logo image.</li>

				<li>New German translation.</li>

				<li>The "Cysol" theme: New font color in text
				areas.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.50 (September 15, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>URLs are made into links now.</li>

				<li>You can now delete multiple messages directly in
				the header list.</li>

				<li>Fixed a line break bug in write.php which on some
				Unix systems caused the Content-Type header to appear
				in the body of the message.</li>

				<li>New themes: "Dark City", "Ochre", and "Silver
				Sage".</li>

				<li>Spanish translation.</li>

				<li>Improved README.html.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.41 (September 6, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>New theme: "Cysol".</li>

				<li>New theme: "Yellow".</li>

				<li>French translation.</li>

				<li>Updated the Latvian translation.</li>

				<li>Updated the Turkish translation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.40 (August 29, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>It is now possible to have more than one preset POP
				server, port, and username. In settings.php, you can
				enter a list of POP servers, ports, and usernames to
				use, and then Instant Web Mail will display those lists
				in select boxes on the log-in page.</li>

				<li>Added another field to the log-in screen: "Your
				email address". The reason is that a lot of
				people have complained that Instant Web Mail doesn't
				show the correct "From" address in the compose window.
				Unfortunally, it's almost impossible for the program to
				guess the user's email address since there are tons of
				different ways of writing POP usernames - so what
				better way to solve the problem than let the user
				specify his/her email address?...</li>

				<li>settings.php now has help texts for some of the configuration options.</li>

				<li>The bug that caused certain message bodies to
				disappear should be completely fixed now.</li>

				<li>Updated the Norwegian and the Turkish translation.</li>

				<li>Swedish translation.</li>

				<li>Polish translation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.30 (August 24, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>The bug that caused some message bodies to
				mysteriously disappear has been fixed.</li>

				<li>The ability to set the priority of outgoing mail
				has been added.</li>

				<li>New theme: "Blue".</li>

				<li>Brazilian Portuguese translation.</li>

				<li>Italian translation.</li>

				<li>Norwegian translation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.22 (August 19, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>Added the possibility to request return receipts.</li>

				<li>Better attempts to guess the user's email address
				in the compose window.</li>

				<li>Dutch translation.</li>

				<li>German translation.</li>

				<li>Portuguese translation.</li>

				<li>Turkish translation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.21 (August 17, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>In version 0.20, the default language had been set
				to Danish by accident. Version 0.21 changes the default
				language to English.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.20 (August 16, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>Added theme support.</li>

				<li>Optional formatting of plain text messages: *Bold*
				is converted to <b>Bold</b>, /italic/ is converted
				to <i>italic</i>, and _underlined_ is converted to
				<u>underlined</u>.</li>

				<li>Internet Explorer and Opera users might have had
				problems replying and forwarding due to JavaScript
				issues. These issues have been resolved.</li>

				<li>Fixed a bug which in some cases would cause the
				sender address in the compose window to be something
				like "someone@example.com@example.com".</li>

				<li>Russian translation.</li>

				<li>Latvian translation.</li>

				<li>Improved about.php.</li>

				<li>Improved README.html..</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.12 (August 12, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a JavaScript error that would occur whenever the
				user clicked on "New letter".</li>

				<li>Improved README.html.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Version 0.11 (August 12, 2001)
			<ul>
				<li>Added automatic checking of new
				mail.</li>

				<li>Fixed a minor bug that caused the recipient and
				sender address to be the same in the "Forwarded letter"
				portion of the compose window.</li>

				<li>Improved README.html.</li>

				<li>Improved about.php.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
