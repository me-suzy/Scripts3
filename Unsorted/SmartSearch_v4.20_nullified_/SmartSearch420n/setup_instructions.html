<p align="center"><u><strong>Smart Search (v4.19) Setup Instructions</strong></u></p>

<p><strong><u><font color="red">Setup</font></u></strong>

If you're installing new or upgrading from a version of Smart Search earlier than 4.0, follow the
standard installation directions.  If upgrading from version 4.0 or later, follow <a href="#upgrade2">these instructions</a>.

</p><p><u><b>Installation Directions</b></u></p>

<p><strong>With Remote Shell (Telnet) Access:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Upload setup.pl and setup.dat to your server (ASCII mode) in the
   directory where you want Smart Search to store its files
  </li><li>Open a Telnet (or other remote shell) connection to your server
  </li><li>Change to the directory which contains setup.pl and setup.dat
  </li><li>Type "which perl" and hit enter - this will tell you where Perl is located on your
   server.  You will need to give setup.pl this information.
  </li><li>Run "perl setup.pl"
  </li><li>Type in the server path to Perl and hit enter.
  </li><li>Confirm that you've entered the proper path
  </li><li>setup.pl will create all necessary directories and files with the
   appropriate file permissions, and will automatically write the path to Perl
   that you've entered in CGI files that need it
  </li><li>You can now close Telnet
  </li><li><a href="#upgrade">Finish upgrading</a> or <a href="#complete"> complete the installation</a>
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Without Remote Shell Access:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>On all .cgi files in the main directory, put the path to Perl
on your    server at the top of the file, using your favorite text editor.
 On most    servers the path is either    /usr/bin/perl (this is the default
- all necessary files in the .zip already have this) or /usr/local/bin/perl
- the line at the top needs to have    a #! before the server path, so if
your directory is /usr/bin/perl, the    line you need to put at the top of
the main .cgi files is "#!/usr/bin/perl" (without the quotes).    You do
not need to do this to any .cgi files in the include directory.   </li><li>Open include/functions.cgi in your editor.  The first three lines will look like:
  <p>
    $accounts_dir = 'accounts';<br>
    $data_dir = 'data';<br>
    $adminkey = 'qxxopz';<br>
  </p>
  <p>Let me explain.  Those who are familiar with the Smart Search directory
   structure could open your data directory in their browsers and open the
   file containing your admin password and attempt to crack it. To avoid this,
   you can (and should) create random directories for "accounts" and "data" and
   at the same time you should set a new value for $adminkey (this is used for
   some encryption on your site).  To do this, change the variable values to
   a random value of the form 'accounts-asdfls' for accounts and 'data-eriuas'
   for data (use whatever random string you want), and change adminkey to any
   random string (should be between 6-8 characters, containing only letters
   and numbers). Make sure you remember the values you gave to $accounts_dir and
   $data_dir, as you will later have to create directories with these names.</p>
  <p>Do not change anything else in functions.cgi</p>
  </li><li>Upload all files except setup.pl and setup.dat to your server in the appropriate directory. When
   uploading files, recreate the directory structure on your server. Many FTP
   programs can do this easily - simply select all Smart Search files and
   directories and select upload (ASCII mode).
  </li><li>Rename the accounts and data directories to whatever you placed in functions.cgi
   earlier.
  </li><li>Now it's time to change some file permissions. For the following instructions,
   if your program uses checkboxes, use the following:

  </li><li>CHMOD subdirectories "a"-"z" and "misc" in directory "keywords" to 777 (if the program you use for .zip

<p><strong>Upgrade from a version earlier than 4.0</strong></p>

Smart Search v4.xx stores some data files in a slightly different format, so it
will be necessary for you to perform the following steps to upgrade from
previous versions of Smart Search:

<ul>
  <li>Clean up your old installation, i.e. delete old files, approve or
    deny any pending submissions, etc.
  </li><li>Once you've set Smart Search up to this point, open update.cgi in your
    browser. Update.cgi will prompt you for the directory containing the old
    version.  Type that directory name in and submit the form. Update.cgi will
    then copy the old data files into the new directory in the new format.
  </li><li>When update.cgi is finished, go to admin.cgi in your new installation
    and click on the link that says "Rebuild Keyword Database" in the
    Miscellaneous section.
  </li><li>Once you've tested and confirmed that the new installation has
    successfully copied over your old settings and other data, feel free to
    delete your old installation and rename the new directory to take its place.
  </li><li>Remove update.cgi from the new installation's directory
  </li><li>Update.cgi will copy most, but not all, of your old settings and other
    data files. (<a href="#perlupdate">See Below</a>)
</li></ul>

<a name="complete"></a>
<p><strong>Complete the Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Open <strong>admin.cgi</strong> in your browser and use any name and password to log-in.
  </li><li>Be sure to create an administrator account, and set up other aspects of
   Smart Search from admin.cgi.  Most important are setting an encryption
   word and inputting the directory and URL of the Smart Search scripts.
  </li><li>If you used setup.pl to set up Smart Search, you can now remove setup.pl and setup.dat from your server. You should
   also remove install.log, but you may want to download it before deleting so
   that you have a copy on your server. Install.log is useful for
   verifying that the setup was successful, but it should not be left on your
   server
  </li><li>If you need to accept payments from Smart Search, set up the R3N3 Payment
   Gateway script and register Smart Search with the gateway via the Financial
   Settings of admin.cgi, but remember to set the URL and directory of the
   Payment Gateway scripts first.
  </li><li>You are done! Test it out now...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What setup.pl Does:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sets up the Smart Search directory structure and copies files to their
   appropriate locations with the correct file permissions
  </li><li>Assigns the accounts directory and data directory a partially random name.
   This is to prevent people who are familiar with how Smart Search stores data
   from accessing your information directly from a browser.
  </li><li>Stores the values of the random directories so that the script knows
   where to store data
  </li><li>Puts the path to Perl at the top of every CGI file that needs it
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Special Notes on Editting Templates:</strong></p>

<p>The ability to control every aspect of Smart Search's output is a very
powerful feature, but you need to be made aware of a few things:
</p><ul>
  <li>To insert dynamic information into a template, special tags such as &lt;&lt;NAME&gt;&gt;
   are used. When editting templates from admin.cgi, the script will show a list
   of valid insertion tags for that template.  When the template is saved, the script checks to make
   sure that all tags present in the template are valid and that required tags
   aren't left out. So, after saving a template, make sure to check if there's
   a message below the line that says "Changes Saved."
  </li>
  <li>On e-mail templates, the script checks the e-mail headers for validity and
   warns if it discovers an unrecognized header.  The script also checks to make sure
   that there is a "To:" header present, and that there is a blank line between
   the e-mail headers and the body of the message.
  </li>
  <li>On many templates, there is a &lt;&lt;RESULTS&gt;&gt; or similar tag, where.
   a list of items is inserted into the template. Another template is used to
   determine how this list appears, and that template is used once for each item
   in the list. This second template (in some cases a third template as well) will
   be displayed below the main template on the editting screen.
   <p>If you're having
   a tough time visualizing this, go to the Templates section of admin.cgi and
   edit the Search Results template under Smartsearch.cgi Templates. The first
   file defines the main page, which contains a &lt;&lt;RESULTS&gt;&gt; tag. Where
   this tag is found, the script will insert a list of matching search results,
   according to the second or third template, depending on whether or not the bid is
   a free listing (or comes from an external search engine other than Searchfeed) or
   a paid listing.</p>
   <p>In the default templates, you can see that each listing has its own
   paragraph inside of a list, but the tags to start and end the list
   (&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;/ol&gt;) appear in the main Search Results template.

</p></li></ul>
<p>Take some time to customize the look and feel of your site.  The default templates
are very bare and minimal, but they should give a good idea of how to use
the template system.</p>


<p><b><a name="upgrade2">Upgrading an Existing Installation</a></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>For versions 4.0-4.17:</b> Open "include/functions.cgi" in your favorite text editor and change the lines at the top that
    read:
    <p>
      $data_dir = 'data';<br>
      $accounts_dir = 'accounts';<br>
      $adminkey = 'qxxopz';
    </p>
    <p>
      to match the data and accounts directory names on your server.  The value
      of adminkey is used for certain encryption purposes.  Make sure that when changing
      adminkey, you use only letters or numbers, and it only needs to be about 4-8 characters long.

    Unless the path to Perl on your server is "/usr/bin/perl", you will need to change the top line
    of every .cgi file in the main directory to correspond to where Perl is located on your server.
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy all .cgi files in the main and "include" directories to your server in ASCII mode,
    overwriting the old files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload rebuild.pl and update.pl to your server in ASCII mode.  These two files are used to rebuild
    the keyword database and
    update your installation from the shell, respectively.  These are needed for installations
    with a large amount of members and keywords, as doing things through a browser may cause
    time-out errors.
  </li>
  <li>
  	CHMOD the files you just uploaded to 755 (all .cgi files, rebuild.pl and update.pl)
  </li>
  <li>
    In your "translations" directory, delete any existing files and replace them with  included in
    this version's "translations" directory - admin-templates.txt and admin-settings.txt (upload in ASCII).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you haven't already customized your templates, then upload all templates (in the "templates"
    directory) in ASCII mode.  If you have customized your templates, then the differences in v4.13 are as follows:

    <ol><p><b>From v4.0:</b></p>

      </li>
      <li>
		In the included Accounts.cgi Header template (templates/accounts_header.tpl), copy the JavaScript to
		your header to prevent a JavaScript error.
      </li>
      <li>
        Examine the Accounts.cgi listings display page (templates/accounts_manage_display.tpl)
        to update the listings page to support a checkbox that can select/de-select all listings on the page.

    will prevent problems with non-alphabetical keywords
  </li>
  <li>
    Update the R3N3 Payment Gateway Script to v1.05
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Instructions:</strong>

</p><ul>
  <li>Send people to signup.cgi to create an account,
    to accounts.cgi to add listings (and more), and smartsearch.cgi to perform searches.
    All output templates for these scripts can be changed via admin.cgi</li>
  <li>Run admin.cgi to approve submissions, add money to user accounts, and more.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to include bidded listings on your site somewhere, use the following SSI
    tag:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;!--#include virtual="/path/to/cgi/include.cgi?keywords=<font color="#ff0000">your_keyword</font>&amp;show=<font color="#ff0000">show_number</font>" --&gt;</p>
  <p>Replace <font color="#ff0000">your_keyword</font> with the keyword you want to show
  listings for. Replace <font color="#ff0000">show_number</font><font color="#000000"> with
  the number of listings you want to display (default is 5).</font></p>
  <p>This will display the listings according to the templates for include.cgi.
  See admin.cgi to change these templates.</p>
  <p>If you want to use a Javascript tag instead of SSI, just add "&amp;java=1" to
  the end and put it in a tag like the following:</p>
  <p>&lt;script src="http://www.mysite.com/include.cgi?keywords<font color="#000000">=your_keyword</font><font color="#ff0000">&amp;java=1</font>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to display the top keywords searched for this month, put the following tag.
    Replace <font color="#ff0000">pop_number</font> with the number of keywords you want to
    display.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>
  <p>SSI: &lt;!--#include virtual="/path/to/cgi/include.cgi?pop=<font color="#ff0000">pop_number</font>"
  --&gt;</p>
  <p>JavaScript: &lt;script src="http://www.mysite.com/include.cgi?pop=<font color="#ff0000">pop_number</font><font color="#000000">&amp;java=1</font>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>All information displayed with the <b>include.cgi</b> file can be used by your affiliates too (and they will get credit). For example:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>SSI: &lt;!--#include virtual="/path/to/cgi/include.cgi?keywords=your_keyword&amp;username=<font color="#ff0000">my_username</font>"
  --&gt;</p>
  <p>Java: &lt;script src="http://www.mysite.com/include.cgi?keywords=your_keyword&amp;username=<font color="#ff0000">my_username</font><font color="#000000">&amp;java=1</font>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>You can provide affiliates with a database style print out of
your search results if you want. This can be used by programmers who want
to include your search results in their search engine script. The search
listings will be printed out one per line, in tab delimited format (data
is seperated by tab spaces). Just tell them to use the following URL:<p>
  http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/include.cgi?keywords=<i>your_keywords</i>&amp;username=<i>your_username</i>&amp;db=1

</p></li></ul>

<ul>
  <li>You can also display the results in XML. Simply use the following URL:<p>
  http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/include.cgi?keywords=<i>your_keywords</i>&amp;username=<i>your_username</i>&amp;xml=1

</p></li></ul>

<p><ul>
  <li>
    If you also want to include external results (e.g. Searchfeed, Dmoz, etc.) via include.cgi, use a tag like the following:
    <p>http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/include.cgi?keywords=<i>your_keywords</i>&amp;username=<i>your_username</i>&amp;external=1</p>
  </li>
</ul></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Have your affiliates refer new advertisers with a link of the form:
    <p>http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/signup.cgi?referrer=username</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If you want your keywords to be in organized in categories, put something like the
    following inside the <strong>directories.txt</strong> file:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><small><font color="#008000">tech/hardware/computers/computer accessories/monitors<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/computer accessories/printers<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/computer accessories/scanners<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/ibm<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/compaq<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/mac<br>
  tech/hardware/laptops<br>
  tech/hardware/keyboards<br>
  tech/software</font><font color="#808080"><br>
  </font></small></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now I'll explain... You can put as many directories as you want.
  You don't have to list the main directories,
  just the deepest sub-directory. In the example above I don't need to put:</p>
  <p><font color="#ff0000"><small>tech<br>
  tech/hardware<br>
  tech/hardware/computers<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/computer accessories<br>
  tech/hardware/computers/computer accessories/monitors</small></font></p>
  <p>I only need to put:</p>
  <p><font color="#008000"><small>tech/hardware/computers/computer accessories/monitors</small></font></p>
  <p>The CGI can figure out by itself the directories above that one. Also, DO NOT repeat
  any directories in another group, the CGI will just match the keyword to the first one it
  finds. For example, if you have:</p>
  <p><font color="#ff0000"><small>software/downloads<br>
  music/news<br>
  music/mp3/downloads</small></font></p>
  <p>The "downloads" is repeated, that's not good. What you should put is
  something like this:</p>
  <p><font color="#008000"><small>software/software downloads<br>
  music/news<br>
  music/mp3/mp3 downloads</small></font></p>
  <p>You wouldn't get an error message if you didn't do this, but the CGI would simply take
  the first directory it finds. In the above example (the red one), if someone searched for
  "downloads", the CGI would tell them they are in the
  "software/downloads" category.</p>
  <p>If this was too confusing, you will figure it out as you test the directories out :)</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to let your visitors pick which external search site's results should be
    used, you can give them a form like this:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <form method="post" action="smartsearch.cgi">
    <div align="left"><p><input type="text" name="keywords" size="10"><select name="crawlsite" size="1"><option selected="" value="1">Dmoz.org</option><option value="2">MSN.com</option><option value="3">SearchFeed.com</option><option value="4">AltaVista.com</option><option value="5">RevenuePilot.com</option><option value="0">None</option></select><input type="submit" value="Search" name="submit"></p>
    </div>
  </form>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The HTML for this is:</p>
  <p><font color="#808080"><small><small>&lt;form method="POST"
  action="smartsearch.cgi"&gt;<br>
  &lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text"
  name="keywords" size="10"&gt;&lt;select name="crawlsite"<br>
  size="1"&gt;<br>
  &lt;option selected value="1"&gt;Dmoz.org&lt;/option&gt;<br>
  &lt;option value="2"&gt;MSN.com&lt;/option&gt;<br>
  &lt;option value="3"&gt;SearchFeed.com&lt;/option&gt;<br>
  &lt;option value="4"&gt;AltaVista.com&lt;/option&gt;<br>
  &lt;option value="5"&gt;RevenuePilot.com&lt;/option&gt;<br>
  &lt;option value="0"&gt;None&lt;/option&gt;<br>
  &lt;/select&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Search"
  name="submit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
  &lt;/form&gt;</small></small></font></p>
  <p>This is done by passing on the variable "crawlsite" with the appropriate
  number. 1 is Dmoz.org, 2 is MSN, etc. and 0 (zero) is none (no external search
  results). If you don't use this type of form, the default one will be used (as set via
  admin.cgi).</p>

  <li>If you want to allow people to upload Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets to submit search listings, you will need to install the <b>Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</b> perl module on your server. Ask your web host to install it if you don't know how. Important note: this module requires the <b>OLE::Storage_Lite</b> module to work. And THAT module requires the following modules: <b>IO::Handle</b> (included in IO), <b>IO::File</b> (included in IO), and <b>IO::Scalar</b>.
I know that's a lot of modules, and I hesitated adding the Excel feature
to Smart Search because of all the modules required, but I figured you might
still want this great feature. So it's up to you if you can and want to install
the required modules. You can find perl modules <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" target="_blank">here</a>, and module installation instructions <a href="http://www.rcbowen.com/imho/perl/modules.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Good luck!</li>
</ul>

<p><small>Note: Generally this CGI and its data files should not use up too much space on
your server, except for the click logs which might add up if you have a heavily used site.
For most people 5 MB would be more than enough for this CGI.</small></p>

<p>If you experience any problems with the results pulled from any of the other search
engines (LWP module feature), e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@smarterscripts.com">webmaster@smarterscripts.com</a></p>
