INSTALLATION
---------------------------

Unzip archive to your hard drive.

Edit Configs.pm with a text editor to suit your needs and server info.

Edit all HTML templates in the templates/ and templates/mail folders 
to match your site design.

Upload all files to your server in ASCII mode only.

Change permissions on all .cgi and .pl files to 755
Change permissions on the userdata directory to 766

open and read the directions in checkbounce.pl. It requires some special
steps to operate.

Setup the MySql database like so:

create a database (ie:safelist)

create 2 tables in the database with the following code:

CREATE TABLE users (
	ID BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	Iname VARCHAR(50),
	Iemail VARCHAR(50),
	Ilogin VARCHAR(20),
	Ipass VARCHAR(20),
	Status VARCHAR(20),
	Dayjoined INT(2), 
	PRIMARY KEY(ID));

CREATE TABLE holding (
	ID BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        OwnerID BIGINT,
	Iname VARCHAR(50),
	Iemail VARCHAR(50),
	Ilogin VARCHAR(20),
	Ipass VARCHAR(20),
	Status VARCHAR(20),
	Dayjoined INT(2), 
	PRIMARY KEY(ID));


Thats it.


USAGE
---------------------------

Make a front page for your site and simply make 2 links on it to the 
following two URLs:

signup area:
http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/signup.cgi

and 

members login area:
http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/user.cgi


To use the Web Administration part, simply aim your browser at admin.cgi and login.


To use the automatic bounced email removal functions:
  Your server needs the following perl Modules installed before trying to use this.
     Mail::Audit  --> available freely at http://www.perlcoders.com/packages.
     File::Copy   --> should already be on your server if using perl 5 or above.
     
  To use this you need to configure the email address you specified in Configs.pm 
  as: $adminmail to point to the checkbounce.pl script included in this archive.
  If you are not sure how to pipe email thru a script, ask your system administrator 
  or uplink. Once the $adminemail var is aimed at the script, the script will read all 
  emails and if they are bounces, it will remove the email from your database and can 
  optionally (if set in Configs.pm) disable the users account. Any emails that are 
  not bounces will be sent to the email set for that purpose in checkbounce.pl automaticly.
