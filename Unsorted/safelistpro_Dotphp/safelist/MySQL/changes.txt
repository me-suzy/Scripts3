o  Okay, some of you asked about automatic rebilling. With paypal this is not possible due to them requiring 
   both the users paypal email AND password for rebills. So, what we have done is set it up so the account is 
   disabled after xx days, and pops a screen asking them to pay for another month. (if you choose rebilling)

o  Added Admin Web Panel with the following options available:
      o  Add Users Manually, bypassing payment.
      o  Modify User Info.
      o  Delete Users.
      o  Email Users.

o  Bounced emails module to allow for removing bouncing email addies from the list automatically.
   Handles the following mail daemons bounces:
      o  sendmail
      o  qmail
      o  exim
   These daemons handle the vast majority of internet mail.
      o To use this feature requires your server have Mail::Audit installed.
