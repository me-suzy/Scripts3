============================== 
INSTALLATION 
============================== 

1) Using your mySQL manager, create a database for phpManager. Please remember to add a username to the database, otherwise you won't be able to connect to it. To create the correct tables, use the supplied "phpmanager.sql" dump file. For instructions on how to setup a database, please consult your webhost providers documentation. 

2) Unzip the phpManager.zip file. 

3) Open the "root" folder, then open "connect.php" in Notepad. Enter your database connection details. 

4) FTP into your server, then upload the "root" folder to your base directory (root directory) i.e One level below public_html. You may name this folder anything you wish. 

5) Open "variables.php" in Notepad. Enter into "$rootdirectory" the server path to your "root" folder uploaded in step 4. Do NOT put a trailing slash at the end. 

e.g $rootdirectory = "/home/yourdomain/root"; 

6) Upload the contents of the phpManager folder (minus the "root" folder) to any directory on your server. Chmod 666 all the files in the "emails" directory. 

7) Point your browser to the "admin" folder on your server and login to your Admin CP. The default user/pass is: admin/admin. It is recommended you change this ASAP. 

Admin CP: /admin/index.php 

Client CP: /clients/index.php 

Order Form: /order/index.php
