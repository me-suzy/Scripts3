Smart Search version 4.16
=========================

Instructions:

1. Open the Smart Search zip file and follow the instructions in setup_instructions.html to install the script.

Before doing anything, login to the admin and setup the script (click on the "Settings" link).
Before upgrading from a version older than 4.0, make sure the script is installed properly and that everything works. 
Only then should you follow the upgrade instructions in setup_instructions.html
Don't delete your old files for at least a week.

2. If you want to accept payments with Smart Search, then open the Payment Gateway zip file and 
   follow the instructions in its own setup_instructions.html file.
   Do this before upgrading from an old version of Smart Search as well.
