Installation instructions for RateMyStuff

## UNZIPPING ##

Inside the zip you should find the following files :

	INSTALL.txt      - Installation instructions
        _dbschema.doc    - database layout (most users won't need this)
        admin.php        - administrative menu script
        CHANGES.txt      - revision history
	common.php	 - functions shared among other scripts 
	config.php 	 - configuration variables
        getimage.php     - image display script for static links
        hookup.php       - anonymous contact system script
        index.php        - index (main) page displaying script
        installer.php    - sets up the database and tables
        new.php          - displays newly uploaded images
        report.php       - lets users report offensive photos
        top.php          - displays top 10 best or worst pics
        user.php         - handles user signup/upload/logins
        vote.php         - handles ratings and votes
        templates/       - (directory) holds HTML template files
        images/          - (directory) holds image files

Unzip all of the files. Open config.php and set all of the
variables as indicated.

## EDITING TEMPLATES ##

Next, you'll want to edit the HTML template files contained
within the templates directory. The first thing you'll likely
notice when you open these templates is that they contain
special tokens - in the format %variable% - which will be
automatically replaced by the scripts with the corresponding
content. For example, place the token %random% anywhere you
want a randomly selected image, score, and vote link to appear.

If you're not quite sure how this works, compare the default
index.html template to the RateMyStuff demo available at
http://phplabs.com/demo/ratemystuff. You can see how the tokens
in the template file are replaced with content by the script:
randomly selected images appear in place of %random%, the user
login form appears in place of %loginform%, etc.

The tokens you can use are:

  %random% - displays a random image, score, and voting link
  %loginform% - displays the login form for existing users
  %lastrate% - shows info about the last pic the visitor rated
  %top5% - displays a table containing the top 5 rated pics
  %imageurl% - is replaced with the value of $imageurl in config.php
  %header% - displays whatever is inside templates/header.html
  %footer% - displays whatever is inside templates/footer.html
  %hookup% - displays the HookUp link if the user allows HookUps

Not all templates support all tokens. However, any tokens 
that appear in each default template are supported by that
template. header.html and footer.html can also contain the 
tokens %random% %lastrate% %imageurl% and %loginform%, even
though the default templates do not contain any tokens.

IMPORTANT: When editing the template files, be sure to leave
all forms as-is, with the same action and method attributes.
Some templates, such as random.html, also contain other special
tokens like %tag% and %voteurl% - you will need to leave those
in place. Initially, we suggest simply changing the colors and
replacing "RateMyHedgehog" with the name of your own site; then
when you're sure your new templates work, you can go on to edit
them more in depth. It's a good idea to make backups before 
doing any major editing.

Also note how links are built within the templates. For example,
the signup/upload link calls user.php?func=newuser, the Top 10
Best link calls top.php?sort=best, the Top 10 Worst link calls
top.php?sort=worst, etc. You will need to formulate your links
the same way.

Inside the "templates" directory, you'll also find two text
files, called hookup_mail_new.txt and hookup_mail_reply.txt.
These two files are templates for the email messages users
will receive through the HookUp system. MAKE SURE to leave
the three existing tokens inside both of these templates.

## UPLOADING ##

Once you have edited your template files, upload the entire
RateMyStuff package (all of the scripts, plus the images and
templates directories) to your web server. Be sure that the
scripts and templates are uploaded in ASCII mode and the 
images are uploaded in BINARY mode. Then chmod the images
directory to 777. This step is important, if you do not
chmod 777 the images directory, no one will be able to 
upload any pictures to the site.

Next, RENAME THE ADMIN.PHP FILE TO SOMETHING ELSE. This file
allows you to view reports that users have made about offensive
images, and lets you delete any image by inputting its tag
number. Obviously, if you do not rename admin.php, ANYONE WILL
BE ABLE TO DELETE IMAGES from your site! PLEASE rename this
file.

## DATABASE CREATION ##

Point your browser at installer.php wherever you uploaded the
RateMyStuff scripts. The installer will create the database
and the tables within it. (If your webhost does not allow you
to create MySQL databases through PHP scripts, you will need
to open the _dbschema.doc file and manually run the commands
inside of that file.) As soon as this is done, you should
visit the index page and upload a few pics of your own to seed
the site. It's suggested that you upload 10-20 pics, especially
if you have several %random% tokens on your pages, otherwise
it will be pretty obvious to visitors that your site is new.

Important notes about a fresh installation of RateMyStuff:

  1. Until you upload some pictures, an "uknown image" 
     placeholder will appear anywhere a picture should
     be displayed. Until you have at least 10 pictures
     uploaded, the Top 10, Worst 10, and Newest 10 pages
     will also be "broken." This will fix itself once
     you upload some images.

  2. The first time you upload a picture, you may receive
     errors on the user info page. This is normal (because
     the script is trying to calculate stats about other 
     pictures, which didn't exist). These errors should
     only show up when the first user (you) is created.

#########################################################

[Usage]

Once you have RateMyStuff installed, usage is straightforward.
Just visit the site and encourage others to do the same!

You should occasionally point your browser at your renamed
copy of admin.php to check up on things. If visitors have
reported any images as offensive, they will show up on the
admin menu with quick links to delete (if offensive) or
ignore the report (if the image is fine). From the admin 
area, you can also delete any image by inputting its tag ID,
ban email addresses from signing up, or ban IP addresses
from signing up.
