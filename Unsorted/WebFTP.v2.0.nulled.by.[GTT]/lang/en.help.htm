<h3><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../img/t1.gif"></a> User name :</h3>
<blockquote>
 It's the name of your FTP account given by your administrator or hosting service<br>
 Beware, remember that some FTP servers are case sensitive, so<br>

</blockquote>

<a name="pass">
<h3><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../img/t1.gif"></a> Password :</h3>
<blockquote>
 It's the password that you chosed or that was given with your username<br>
 when you signed up. Remember that some servers are case sensitive, so <br>
 password &laquo; <b>somepass</b> &raquo; and &laquo; <b>SOmEpaSs</b> &raquo; are different.
