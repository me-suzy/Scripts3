Bugs

1.)When registering... These 2 errors appear but registration still works as I received a welcome email: 
Notice: Undefined variable: acctype in /home/domaintracker/domains/register/index.php on line 59
Notice: Undefined variable: acctype in /home/domaintracker/domains/register/index.php on line 66
Issue #1 (Errors during registration)
This error is related to the problem with the link popularity script.
I have added the line:
$acctype = $_POST["acctype"];
at line 59 of /domains/register/index.php.  The script was relying on
the plain variable $acctype on what is now lines 60 and 67 which was
empty.
2.)Login to test/test and the log off does not work
Issue #2 (Logout does not work)
Again, same root cause.  I added changed the line:
if (isset($logout)) {
to:
if (isset($_GET["logout"])) {
at line 24 of /domains/member/index.php to correct this issue.
3.)click on "add custom domain", there will be error
Issue #3 (Error on Add Custom Domain)
Again, same problem.  I added the line:
$domain = $_GET["domain"];
to /domains/member/add_monitor.php at line 39 to resolve the error.
4.)Added: $login = $_SESSION["login"]; in /member/info.php
5.)Domain digger menu fixed 
6.)Search string error
