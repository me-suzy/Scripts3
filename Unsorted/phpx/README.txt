NOTES
--------------------------------------------
To use the domain authentication, you will need to download and make the smauth.so extenstion for PHP.
I have included the .so file for PHP 4.2.3, its in admin/scripts
I have also included the actual SMBAUTH files so you can make your own if you need to.
**I will not support this file, just the PHPX part that connects to it.
