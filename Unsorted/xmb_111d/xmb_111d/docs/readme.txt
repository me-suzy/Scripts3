----------#--- XMB README ---#----------

XMB (Extreme Message Board) is a very proud project of mine. Plans for this
baby have been running through my mind since November 2000, but it was
not until January 2001 (Jan 17th, to be exact) that I took action. But I don't wish
to bore you with a drawn out story of how I exactly developed this, that is of no
interest to you. So instead, I bring you XMB. Enjoy!



Installation:
1. Open up config.php and edit the mysql stuff at the top.
2. Upload everything, retaining the original structure of the files. Everything thing should be in ASCII except the images/ content (binary).
3. Chmod settings.php 766.
4. Run the install script (www.yourdomain.com/file/install.php).
5. Go to your boards and register. It will automatically make you an admin.
6. Visit the control panel (the link will be visible once your logged in) and change stuff. Enjoy!
