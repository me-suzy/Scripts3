THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING PHP LIVE! SUPPORT
****************************************

UPGRADE NOTICE and things you should know
****************************************

We use CVS at our end to keep all the developers on the same page.  When we issue an update, the ideal situation is you just unpack the upgrade and override your current copy.  When we CVS, we ignore the "web/", "pics/", "sounds/", "css/" and the "lang_packs/" directory.  All these directories relate to customizing your copy of PHP Live!.  So when you unpack the new version, it will replace your current files EXCEPT the contents in these directories ("web/", "pics/", "sounds/", "css/", "lang_packs/").

If you decide to modify the code itself, please advise that when you update, the upgrade copy WILL replace your changes.  So if you modify the code, we cannot guarantee and do not provide support problems updating your copy of PHP Live!.
