OSI Codes Inc. Coding Standard (brief description)
This standard is used within all OSI Codes.
-------------------------------------------------------->

All SQL queries are called by function APIs and NEVER
within the code.  This keeps the code clean and organized
so you know exactly what function does what.  And if the
database is changed, you simply change the function, not
the code.

Once you look into the API directory, you will see how we
organize our codes that calls the database.  Since data
is most important, our APIs are highly organized functions,
all within their respective files:

get.php - all sql queries that "gets" the data from db
put.php, - sql queries that "puts" into the db
remove.php - sql queries that deletes from the db
update.php. - you get the point...

In 99% of cases (rare case being in the setup scripts),
there is NEVER a function within the actual page that gets
called by the web.  Rather, all functions resides within
the Util.php directory inside their respective API directory.
But on all our codes, there is a "// functions" area, should
we need it.

---

As for the pages that gets called by the web, these pages
merely calls the API functions.


----
REPEAT: NO SQL QUERIES INSIDE THE ACTUAL PAGES!  This is a
major standard at OSI Codes.  It's a standard that has kept
our application run at top notch, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, easy
to fix, debug and modify.
