PHP Live! Support INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------

*********** FTP INSTALLATION ***********

If you are going to FTP the files to your server, this area is for you.
Otherwise, continue on to Step 1 and disregard this area.

After you unzip the files on your local machine, ftp the "phplive" folder
somewhere on the server that you can access it with an "http:" address.

BE SURE the "web/" directory is READ/WRITE/EXECUTE able.  To do this,
after you have finished FTPing, right click on the "web/" directory ,
select 'permissions' or "CHMOD" option, check ALL the checkboxes, and
apply changes.

Now skip down to step 3 and proceed with installation.

****************************************


1. gunzip, untar or unzip the application somewhere on the server that
you can access it with an "http:" address.


2. (UNIX Only) Change the permissions of the "web/" directory to be
write able by the browser.  The "web/" directory is located in the root
unpacked directory of PHP Live!.

% chmod o+rwx web

For windows NT/XP, if you get permission errors, make sure the "web/"
folder is read/write able by right clicking on the folder and setting
the properties.  You may also need to go to your control panel and allow
the web user (user that is running the web server) full read/write
access to the "web/" folder.


3. Create an empty MySQL database to be used by PHP Live!.  Remember to
restart your MySQL server if you added a new user.  (Don't create any
tables, just create an empty database.)


4. Visit http://www.yourservername.com/phplive/


5. The setup will walk you through an automated, painless Q&A session.
Finish the questions till you get to the "Success" screen.


INSTALLATION COMPLETE!
