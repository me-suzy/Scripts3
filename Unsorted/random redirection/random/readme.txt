Summary:
--------
    When called, random.cgi will select a line with a URL from its
    configuration file and issue a redirection response to that URL.
 
    To use a particular file, take the file's URL and insert random.cgi's
    URL before it.  For instance, if you installed the program as
    "/cgi-bin/random.cgi" and your file is "/random/urls.txt", join
    the two URLs and use "/cgi-bin/random.cgi/random/urls.txt".
