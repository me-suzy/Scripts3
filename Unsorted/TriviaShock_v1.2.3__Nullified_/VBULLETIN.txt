TriviaShock vBulletin Integration Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The new user module system introduced in TriviaShock 1.2.0 allows
TriviaShock to share user databases with other software. TriviaShock
now comes pre-packaged with a vBulletin user module.

This module allows TriviaShock to be directly integrated with your
vBulletin user database. Currently it integrates in the following
ways:

 * Users are authenticated directly from your vBulletin database, 
   giving all of your users access to TriviaShock without having to 
   register again.

 * All links to registration on TriviaShock go directly to your 
   vBulletin registration script.

 * All links to user profiles go directly to the vBulletin profile 
   script for the user.

 * TriviaShock recognizes vBulletin's cookies so users can stay logged 
   in.

 * You can specify which vBulletin user group id has access to the 
   TriviaShock control panel.

 * Optionally, TriviaShock can update the "last activity" time for a 
   vBulletin user if they are using TriviaShock

Setup is very simple using the TriviaShock user module system. Perform 
the normal TriviaShock installation as specified in README.txt, with 
the following in mind:

 1. Make sure to install TriviaShock to the same MySQL database as your
    vBulletin is installed on. Don't worry - the tables won't overlap 
    because all of TriviaShock's tables start with "ts_".

 2. When editing config.inc.php, find the option $C_OPTS['USER_MODULE']
    Make sure it is set to "vbulletin" instead of "standard".

 3. Edit the file "inc/ts_user_vbulletin.inc.php". This is the 
    TriviaShock user module for vBulletin. Edit the first several 
    options as appropriate for your vBulletin installation.

 4. After installing TriviaShock and performing these steps, go to the
    URL where you did the installation. Near the top, the "Registered 
    Users" and "Newest User" fields should match those on your 
    vBulletin installation.

 5. When logging into the control panel, use your vBulletin 
    administrator username and password, or one for whatever group id 
    you gave access to TriviaShock (you can set which group gets 
    access to the control panel by editing 
    "inc/ts_user_vbulletin.inc.php". Don't worry about the admin 
    password you set during TriviaShock installation, it won't be used 
    since you will be using your vBulletin user database.
