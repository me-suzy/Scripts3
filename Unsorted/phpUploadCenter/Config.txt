Sorry for my bad english.

Some hints:
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. You can add your custom page header (i.e. banner at the top or at the bottom of page, or site menu & copyrights) by changing files header.htm & footer.htm, which placed in include folder.

2. You can change info, modifying file info.htm, which placed in include folder.
 If you wish place different info's for different languages you can assign different .htm filenames in language files ($infopage variable).

3. You can change header of digest letter by editing mailinfo.htm file.

4. You can easy edit all above files using configuration panel (configure.php).

5. If you wish change default folder where files will be stored, you can edit variable $uploads_folder_name in file conf.php
 You have to set the relative path without trailing slash
 (e.g. $uploads_folder_name = "/sattv/uploads";)

6. Highly recommended change default user folder by changing $users_folder_name variable. This improve your security.

5. To add your national language you must do following:
  1. Translate existing language file (language files stored in include folder) & save it under name NN.php, where NN - the country code.
  2. Create country flag (image size 25x15) and place it into "images" folder under name NN.gif
  3. Open conf.php file, find languages section and add your language
  4. Please, don't forget send us your translation. We include it in the new release of PHP Upload Center.

6. You can give link to upload center files for a required date:
  http://www.mysite.com/mypage/index.php?showfilesfordate=2002-2-11
  The date format after equal symbol is: Year-Month-Day
