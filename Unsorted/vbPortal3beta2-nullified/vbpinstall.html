<h3>Installing vbPortal (Standard Installation)</h3>
<p>
<b>Current Version is <u>vbPortal30pr8_1.zip</u></b><br><br>

These instructions will cover the standard installation of vbPortal and the directory placement of
vBulletin.  The instructions and examples used in this document are based on default web server settings
for Windows (NT, 2000) and Linux (RedHat 7.0)<br><br>

<b>Terms:</b><br>
<b>public_html:</b>
public_html is used to describe the path to your web site directory. This is the file path and
<b>not</b> the URL.<br><br>
Example (Windows): "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\"<br>
Example (Linux):   "/var/www/html/"
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you have already installed vBulletin please make a backup of your database before
continuing the installation. If vBulletin is not in a sub-directory it is recommended that you move it
into a sub-directory as listed below.<br><br>
<b>If you are NOT installing vbPortal into a sub-directory please skip to the<br>
"Install vBulletin (vBulletin directory placement)" section below</b><br><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Installing vbPortal (in a sub-directory)</b><br>
It is possible to install vbPortal into a sub-directory under your web server. You can use any
sub-directory name that you would like.  In this document <b>vbportal</b> will be used as the
default sub-directory.<br><br>
Example (Windows): "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\vbportal\"<br>
Example (Linux): "/var/www/html/vbportal/"<br>
URL = http://www.yoursite.com/vbportal/index.php (start page for vbPortal)<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> Keep in mind, in the following examples you will need to add your sub-directory name
into the appropriate place.<br><br>

Forum sub-directory:<br>
Example (Windows): "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\vbportal\forums\"<br>
Example (Linux):   "/var/www/html/vbportal/forums/"<br><br>

config.php file:<br>
Example (Windows):<br>
$nukeurl = "http://www.yoursite.com";<br>
$bburl = "http://www.yoursite.com/vbportal/forums";<br>
$nukepath = "C:/inetpub/wwwroot/vbportal";<br>
$vbpath = "C:/inetpub/wwwroot/vbportal/forums";<br><br>

Example (Linux):<br>
$nukeurl = "http://www.yoursite.com";<br>
$bburl = "http://www.yoursite.com/vbportal/forums";<br>
$nukepath = "/var/www/html/vbportal";<br>
$vbpath = "/var/www/html/vbportal/forums";<br><br>

<b>Additional Note:</b> Additional modifications will be necessary if you are installing into a sub-directory.
These modifications will be covered at the end of this file, under <u>Installing vbPortal,
sub-directory, modifications</u><br><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Install vBulletin (vBulletin directory placement)</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>vBulletin should be installed under a sub-directory of your web site. The default sub-directory name is
<b>forums</b>.  You can create any sub-directory name that you like, just make sure you
replace your sub-directory name with the default name "forums".<br><br>

Example (Windows): "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\forums\"<br>
Example (Linux):   "/var/www/html/forums/"<br><br>

<li>Complete the installation of vBulletin. The installation of vBulletin is beyond the scope of this
document.<br>
<li>Make sure that vBulletin has been installed and configured correctly before continuing.
</ol>
</p>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Create New Forums</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Create two new forums.<br>Use the vBulletin admin control panel to create these new forums.
One of these forums will be used for vbPortal's front page news section and the second forum will be
for the vbPortal's front page polls section. You can name these forums whatever you like.<br><br>
<li>After creating these two new forums hold your mouse pointer over the link of each forum and
write down the forumid number for each.  The forumid numbers will be used in the vbPortal's
config.php file to configure the front page news and polls sections.
</ol>
</p>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Upload and Install vbPortal files</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip the vbPortal zip file to a temporary directory on your computer.<br><br>
Example (Windows): C:\temp\vbPortal\<br>
Example (Linux): /tmp/vbPortal/<br><br>

<li>Go into the temporary vbPortal "public_html" directory (cd C:\temp\vbPortal\public_html\).
 Copy all the files including the directories
(DO NOT CHANGE THE DIRECORIES LAYOUT) to your web servers public_html directory
(see public_html term above).<br><br>
Example (Windows): copy files and directories from "C:\temp\vbPortal\public_html\" to "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\"<br>
Example (Linux): copy files and directories from "/tmp/vbPortal/public_html/" to "/var/www/html/"<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> During the copying process you may be prompted to overwrite some files.  These are
gif files that are used for the main image and buttons.  By default it's best just to overwrite
these gif files.
</ol>
</p>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Access vbPortal install file</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Through a web browser access vbPortal's install file which is located under
forums/admin/vbpinstall.php.<br><br>
Example: http://www.yoursite.com/forums/admin/vbpinstall.php<br><br>

<li>Follow through the vbPortal install script and select which option you would like to
install.<br><br>

<li>At the <b>"Click here for instructions on the vB script mods needed."</b> Click on the link and
follow the instructions.  Some of these modifications are <b>required</b> and some are <b>optional</b>.
Please read through this section carefully.<br><br>

<li>There is an additional section that covers <b>TOPICS</b>.
If you selected the Full Install or Installed TOPICS you will need to make modifications to
several of the vBulletin php files. Make sure that the modifications are done correctly. To access
this file again it is located under forums/admin/vbpscripts.html.
</ol>
</p>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Upload/Import and Configure vbPortal Default Style</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Make a back of your existing default vBulletin style set by using the vBulletin admin control
panel, Styles, Download/Upload option.<br><br>

<li>Depending on your version of vBulletin, (2.2.4, 2.2.5 or 2.2.6) open the Default22x.style.style file in a text editor.  The file is located in the temporary directory under the style directory.<br><br>
Example (Windows): C:\temp\vbPortal\style\Default226.style<br>
Example (Linux): /tmp/vbPortal/style/Default226.style<br><br>

Look at the very first line.<br>
If you are using vBulletin version 2.2.1 it should look like this <b>2.2.1|||</b><br>
If you are using vBulletin version 2.2.0 it should look like this <b>2.2.0|||</b><br><br>

Make the change to fit your version of vBulletin.(DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE, unless you know what
you are doing.)<br><br>

<li>Upload the Default22x.style set file by using the same Download/Upload
option. When uploading the Default22x.style set choose to overwrite the "Default" style.<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> If you are having trouble uploading the Default22x.style copy the Default22x.style
file to the forums/admin/ directory.  Use the vBulletin admin control panel, Styles, Download/Upload, Import
existing style set (from local computer) option. Change the Style file: (local) name to
"Default22x.style". If you are still having trouble, close all browser windows and try this process
again.  This mainly applies to Windows servers.<br><br>

<li>After uploading the Default22x.style correctly you will need to modify a setting under Styles, Modify,
Default, [font/colors/etc], Image paths. Look for "http://www.yoursite.com/forums/images" and change it
to match your web site. Save your changes.<br><br>

<li>Now click on Replacements, Modify, Default, expand list. Under Custom Replacements look for this<br>
"images/smilies is replaced by http://www.yoursite.com/forums/images/smilies".<br>  Click on edit and
change the www.yoursite.com to match your web site. Save your changes.
</ol>
</p>

<hr width="25%" align="left">
<b>Configure vbPortal's config.php file</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Change to the public_html (not the temporary directory) directory and rename or copy the
config.php.txt file to config.php.  Open the config.php file in a text editor.  The most important
section of the config.php file is the <b>General Site Configuration</b> section.  The variables
listed below must be configured correctly.  If they are not correct then your site will not be
displayed correctly.<br><br>

<b>Default settings</b>
<table><tr>
<td>$nukeurl = "http://www.yoursite.com";</td><td>// This is the URL to your vbportal web site</td></tr>
<tr><td>$bburl = "http://www.yoursite.com/forums";</td><td>// This is the URL to your forums web site</td></tr>
<tr><td>$nukepath = "/home/public_html";</td><td>// This is the file path to your web directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>$vbpath = "/home/public_html/forums";</td><td>// This is the file path to your forums directory</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Windows users may need to use forward slashes instead of back slashes<br>
Example (Windows):<br>
$nukeurl = "http://www.yoursite.com";<br>
$bburl = "http://www.yoursite.com/forums";<br>
$nukepath = "C:/inetpub/wwwroot";<br>
$vbpath = "C:/inetpub/wwwroot/forums";<br><br>

Example (Linux):<br>
$nukeurl = "http://www.yoursite.com";<br>
$bburl = "http://www.yoursite.com/forums";<br>
$nukepath = "/var/www/html";<br>
$vbpath = "/var/www/html/forums";<br><br>

Make the necessary changes to match your web server.<br><br>

<li>Under The News Config section change<br>
$newsforum=3;<br>
to match the forumid number of the news forum that you created earlier.<br>
Do the same for<br>
$pollsforums=4;<br><br>

<li>If you did a Full Install or installed the TOPICS option find<br>
$hastopics=0; and change it to<br>
$hastopics=1;<br>
This will enable the Topics option.<br><br>

<li>Make any additional changes to the config.php file to suit your needs.<br><br>

<li>Save the changes made to the config.php file.<br>
</ol>
That's it.
</p>

<hr width="100%">
<b>Installing vbPortal, sub-directory, modifications</b>
<ol>
<li>Modify "Main Menu" links<br>
Access and login to the vbPortal Administration section.  http://www.yoursite.com/vbportal/admin.php<br>
Click on Side Blocks, under Main Menu click on the edit block icon. (Looks like magnifying glass &
paper)<br>
Basically, remove the "/" from the a href=" ..." so it looks like this<br>
a href="index.php">Home<....<br>
Do the same thing to the rest of the Main Menu Links<br>
You will also need to do this to the Administration Block also.<br><br>

<li>Open the config.php file in a text editor.  Look for the $foot1 variable.  Find the<br>
img src=\"/images/vbp.gif\" and change it to<br>
img src=\"$nukeurl/images/vbp.gif\"<br><br>

<li>Open includes/blocks/admin.php in a text editor.  Look for this line<br>
global $bburl,$DB_site,$admin,$prefix,$newsforum,$block_sidetemplate;<br>
change it to<br>
global $bburl,$DB_site,$admin,$prefix,$newsforum,$block_sidetemplate,$nukeurl;<br><br>

Find this<br>
a href=\"admin.php?op=reviews\">"._WREVIEWS."<br>
change it to this
a href=\"$nukeurl/admin.php?op=reviews\">"._WREVIEWS."<br><br>

Find this<br>
a href=\"admin.php?op=links\">"._WLINKS."<br>
change it to this
a href=\"$nukeurl/admin.php?op=links\">"._WLINKS."<br><br>
</ol>

That's it for the Installing vbPortal, sub-directory, modifications section.
