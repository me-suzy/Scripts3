=======================================

   For upgrades from previous 2.X versions of vbPortal:
   There is no upgrade path, except as follows... 

   * Ideally I would suggest you go though a new install, then export your 
     data from the old database and import into the new. But this is beyond the scope of this 
     install procedure and my support, I just suggested it for a nice clean install.
   
   * You will "NOT" loose any data in your vBulletin tables including news or polls.

   * Backup your database and download a copy of your vbPortal 2.0x style set 
     using the Styles, Download / Upload utility in your vBulletin Admin Control Panel.
        
   * copy the vbpinstall.php script to the vBulletin admin sub-directory and run it from your browser.
     There has an option to remove all old vbPortal 2.x tables, except the weblinks. 

   * From your vBulletin admin, delete all the old vbPortal 2.0 template sets, Style and Replacement
     variables, then revert all Default templates back to the vBulletin out of the box default.

   * Next proceed with the New Installs procedure. See the new_install.txt file.
