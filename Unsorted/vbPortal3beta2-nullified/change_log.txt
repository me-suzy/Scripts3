1. Created on new template "P_error_nopermission_loggedout" actually a duplicate of the vbulletin template, 
   but with the path defined with $burl. Reverted the vBulletin template back to default. It was causing
   redirection errors. This new template can be used in place like the downloads script where you want to 
   restrict to members only.

   e.g.
    if ($bbuserinfo['userid']==0) {
	eval("standarderror(\"".gettemplate("P_error_nopermission_loggedout")."\");");
    }else{
	$username=$bbuserinfo['username'];
    }

2. Replaced $vbpvars code snippet in the mainfile with an expanded function called getvbpvars(),
   this function has been placed in all the included add-ons just after the mainfile.php include,
   What's it do?
   It grabs certain vBulletin replacement variables from the current style and converts them to vars,
   so that you can use them in the addons.
   e.g. 
   The {imagesfolder} would be $imagesfolder

   if (!isset($mainfile)) { include("mainfile.php"); }
   getvbpvars();
   echo "<br><center><a href=\"download.php\"><img src=\"$imagesfolder/download/down-logo.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a><br><br>";
