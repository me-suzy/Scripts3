Installation instructions for the Prediction League.

Requirements
============
Web server with support for PHP4.0 or greater.
MySQL database.

Instructions
============
Modify the file SystemVars.php to match your configuration.
Open the file SystemVars.php in your favourite editor.
N.B. The "" and ; in the file are important, please be careful
when you edit the file.

 1. Set the Title for your prediction league. e.g. 
    $PredictionLeagueTitle = "My Prediction League";

 2. Set the Header Row. This can be used for displaying a banner
    or text. The header row can contain HTML.
    e.g.
     $HeaderRow = "<table width=\"800\"><tr><td align=\"center\" class=\"TBLHEAD\"><font 
    class=\"TBLHEAD\"><img src=\"banner.jpg\"></font></td></tr></table>";

 3. Set the hostname for the database. If your database and webserver are on the
    same machine, you can probably leave this set as localhost. If they are
    on different machines contact your ISP for hostname details.

 4. Set the base directory name.
    This can be left as the default value if you copy this folder directly to
    your website. If you rename the folder, you need to update the base
    directory name accordingly.

 5. Set the database username. This is the value provided by your ISP.

 6. Set the database password. This is the value provided by your ISP.

 7. Set the database name. This is the value you will use when creating the database.
    If you have been given a database name by you ISP, you will need to enter this
    here.

 8. Set the email address of the administrator. This is the address used by your
    users to contact you.

 9. Set the signature for the administrative emails. When a new user is created
    an email is automatically sent. This signature will appear at the bottom of
    the email.

 10.Set the default icon. This is an optional step. If you want to use a different
    icon for your users, you can set the value here. The icon must be available in
    the default icon directory to be automatically available to the users.

 11.Set the chat room URL. If you use a chat room, you can use this to provide a 
    link from the menu to the chatroom. A blank value will ensure that the menu
    item does not appear.

 12.Set the URL and title for your homepage.

 13.If you want to log warnings and errors on your system give the logfile a name. 
    Leaving it as "" will disable this functionality. If you do enable the use
    of the logfile, the process running the web server must have write permission 
    for the logfile.
    e.g. if your server is running as 'nobody' on a unix system, then the user
    'nobody' must be able to write to the file.

 14.If you want to allow multiple users to be created for each email address, then 
    set this value to TRUE.

 15.If you want to encrypt passwords then set leave this value as TRUE.

 16.If you have a prize to display. Update the file prize.html. The current contents
    can be uncommented and changed. It is assumed you know some HTML to be able
    to make the changes.
