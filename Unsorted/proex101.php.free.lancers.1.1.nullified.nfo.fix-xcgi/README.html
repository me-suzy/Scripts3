3. Read and then run one-timesetup.php by clicking on the "Run" link.<br>
4. Go to admin_setup.php, (after you run one-timesetup.php, the password will already be given when you click on the link to go to admin_setup.php), customize the form fields to fit your website, and then save the variable.<br>
5. Create a file named privacy.html containing your privacy policy and upload it to the same directory that the PHP Freelancers script by <a href="http://www.proex101.com/" target="_blank">ProEx101</a> is in.<br>

<a name="err">Error</a> Instructions For PHP Freelancers by <a href="http://www.proex101.com/" target="_blank">ProEx101</a>:<br>
- If you get an error related to "MySQL Error", contact <a href="mailto:DaDJRock@SmartCGIs.com">DaDJRock@SmartCGIs.com</a> immediately, this means that your script has experienced a fatal error.<br>
- If you get an error related to "Parse Error", that means that you (or a programmer who customized/installed the script for you) has interrupted the printing of any HTML forms, etc. by forgetting to include \ before a " or ' (depending on the section of the script), etc.  We suggest that you either get a refund if you got someone else to do this for you, and/or just plain old visit <a href="http://www.SmartCGIs.com/phpfreelancers/" target="_blank">http://www.SmartCGIs.com/phpfreelancers/</a> and click on the "Installation" link.  This could also be caused if you are running a less than required version of PHP.<br>
- If you get any other type of error, it is due to your customization of the script, and we suggest that you visit <a href="http://www.SmartCGIs.com/phpfreelancers/" target="_blank">http://www.SmartCGIs.com/phpfreelancers/</a> and click on the "Installation" link.<br>

<a name="bug">Known</a> Bugs For PHP Freelancers by <a href="http://www.proex101.com/" target="_blank">ProEx101</a>:<br>
Bug 1: You may get errors all over your script and you are positive you didn't do anything wrong, this is because you don't have a server that is not capable of the version of PHP that is required to run this script.<br>
Fix 1: Unavailable!  We are trying our very best to require only the lowest version of PHP, but a lot of newer scripting functionality is needed.<br>
Bug 2: If you suspend/ban an IP address from PHP Freelancers, and for every user of yours who visit the script (even if they're not banned or suspended), it might display the banned/suspended message and disable them access.  This is because a variable is used in PHP called $REMOTE_ADDR, your server may not return the proper value, but this doesn't happen often unless you use a shared server.<br>
Fix 2: The admin can update whether they want to have the feature to disable/enable the banned/suspended functions.  If they disable this, the above bug will not occur.<br>
- If you find a bug in the script, please immediately contact <a href="mailto:DaDJRock@SmartCGIs.com">DaDJRock@SmartCGIs.com</a> clearly stating the time and date the bug was shown, the url/web address to the file the bug was found in, where the bug was found in that file, and a detailed description of the bug that was found.  If this happens and it is a real bug, you will get the bug update free automatically.<br>
