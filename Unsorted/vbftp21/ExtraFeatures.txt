Additional Features (already inbuilt)

1. Password Protect vB FTP.
---------------------------

In "ftp.php", find:


PHP:  

$use_login    =    true;            // Toggle login system (true/false).
$auto_login    =    true;            // Toggle auto login (true/false).
$username    =    "";    // Set a username
$password    =    "";    // Set a password.


Enter a username and password in the blank space - it can be ANYTHING you like, it doesn't have to be your real FTP username and password.

This will password protect your vB FTP. You will have to enter that username and password to access this function. This will prevent other admins from accessing your site. 

You can set auto login as well using the variables - basically this means that once you log in with this additional username and password, a cookie will be made, so that you will automatic login the next time. By default this is switched on.


2. Toggle functions of FTP on or off.
------------------------------------

You can switch on or off each function of vB FTP.

In "ftp.php", find:


PHP:  

$allow_view    =    true;
$allow_create    =    true;
$allow_edit    =    true;
$allow_chmod    =    true;
$allow_rename    =    true;
$allow_delete    =    true;
$allow_download    =    true;
$allow_upload    =    true;


It's self explanatory. Change it to "false" if you want to switch that function off.


3. Type of files you can edit.
------------------------------

You can set the filename extension of files you want to be able to edit.

In "ftp.php", find:

PHP:  

$text_files    =    array(            // Editable files
                               "txt",
                               "php",
                               "phtml",
                               "php4",
                               "php3",
                               "html",
                               "htm",
                               "css",
                               "xml",
                               "xsl",
                               "bat",
                               "log",
                               "ini",
                               "inf",
                               "cfg",
                             );



Just add any extension you like to that list. There are other lists as well underneath this that you can customize.


4. Hide files or directories.
-----------------------------

You can set files or directories to be hidden.

In "ftp.php", find:


PHP:  

$ignore_file_strings        =    array(
                                               ".htaccess",
                                             );
$ignore_file_extensions        =    array(
                                               "foo",
                                               "bar",
                                             );
$ignore_directory_strings    =    array(
                                               "secret dir",
                                             );




Just add it to the list. It's self-explanatory.


5. Changing the timeout (if you have trouble downloading or uploading large files).
-----------------------------------

In "ftp.php", find:


PHP:  

$use_timeout    =    false;
$timeout    =    30;



By default, this is switched off. You can turn it on by changing "false" to "true", and entering the timeout figure in seconds.


6. Change the default directory/ Go higher all the way to root dir
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I made the forum directory the highest directory you can access by default. To change the highest directory you can access-

In "ftp.php", find:

PHP:  

$home_dir    =    "../";


Change "../" to the default directory you want to open vB FTP in - put in the full path.

For example:

PHP:  

$home_dir    =    "/home/site/var/www/html/forums";


To go to the ROOT directory, replace it with this:

PHP:  

$home_dir    =    "/";


There you go! Whatever you put as the default directory is the HIGHEST directory you can go up to.

It works. So you can go as high as you want changing that variable.


Enjoy these extra features! They are already in-built in the hack. 

Enjoy!
