<h1>Help File</h1>

<p>This help file contains information of interest to and dedicated for 
the average visitor browsing this site.</p>


<h2><a name="email">Email</a></h2>
<p>A valid email address is needed to register your retail digital product download. 
Registration is free and automatic.</p>
 
<p>If you subscribe to the newsletter your email address may also be used to 
inform you of product news. Your email address is needed to subscribe or to 
unsubscribe from the newsletter.</p>

<h3>Selectable by Developer</h3>
<p>Your product choice may sent to you via email. If so, the email you 
provide in the email field is used as the recipient address. This email address 
must be valid in order for you to receive digital product.</p>


<h2><a name="privacy">Privacy</a></h2>
<UL>
<LI>High - you will never hear from us
<LI>Medium - you will accept some email only from us
<LI>Low - you will accept any information from us or others.
</UL>


<h2><a name="newsletter">Newsletter</a></h2>

newsletter. If so, you may subscribe by checking the newsletter box during

<h2><a name="hitsthisproduct">Hits this Product</a></h2>
<p>The number of hits per product can be set by the system administrator.
The default logic is to increment a single product hit counter when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the specific product <b>Showcase</b> page is loaded or
<li>the <b>Free Download</b> page is loaded or
<li>the internet payment transaction is completed or 
<li>the <b>Featured Product</b> page is loaded ( and the product is on it )
</ul>

<p>This means that the &quot;Hits this Product&quot; is really 
page views per product. In no way does it reflect actual downloads.
</p>

<p>The &quot;Hits this Product&quot; counter is periodically reset, and so 
the counter may not accurately reflect total hits. Why bother with counters at all? 
The counter is a useful measure of website activity, interest and 
usage patterns. Data may be processed to yield pertinent business 
information and to improve the usefulness of the website for the 
visitor.
