I'll bet he would have made a lousy painter or window-washer - or Web site builder. 
<p>
A Web site is like a puppy. It starts with enthusiasm, but if you don't give it regular care and attention it will embarrass you later. 
<p>
Your site's size and complexity should be constrained by your ability to maintain its accuracy, timeliness and freshness. 
<p>
Some short-lived features may be beyond your ability to replace them frequently. So don't build them in the first place. It's better to have fewer pages than to have stale ones. 
<p>
If you have a good programmer on your Web team, you can put in some simple automated content management tools. 
<p>
Put a hidden comment in each page that indicates when it should be updated next, then regularly run a program that scans your pages looking for those that have reached their "best-before" date. Change that best-before date every time you update its page. Different pages will have different "shelf lives." 
<p>
The grocery store analogy is appropriate. Some of what's on a grocery store's shelves will keep indefinitely, but a month-old newspaper or cabbage won't do much for the ambience. So appoint a stockperson today to make sure everything is fresh every day.
