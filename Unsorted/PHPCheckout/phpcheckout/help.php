<h2><a name="hitsthisproduct">Hits this Product</a></h2>
<p>The number of hits per product can be set by the system administrator.
The default logic is to increment a single product hit counter when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the specific product <b>Showcase</b> page is loaded or
<li>the <b>Free Download</b> page is loaded or
<li>the internet payment transaction is completed or 
<li>the <b>Featured Product</b> page is loaded ( and the product is on it )
</ul>

<p>This means that the &quot;Hits this Product&quot; is really 
page views per product. In no way does it reflect actual downloads.
</p>

<p>The &quot;Hits this Product&quot; counter is periodically reset, and so 
the counter may not accurately reflect total hits. Why bother with counters at all? 
The counter is a useful measure of website activity, interest and 
usage patterns. Data may be processed to yield pertinent business 
information and to improve the usefulness of the website for the 
visitor.
