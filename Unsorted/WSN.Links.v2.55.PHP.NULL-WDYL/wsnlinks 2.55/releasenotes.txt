This file is a list of changes in WSN Links from version to version. No release dates are listed, but the release of 1.00 was in August of 2002. 1.23 was late January of 2003, and 2.00 came about in February.

Releases which were soley bug fixes have been omitted from the list below, and many bug fixes have been omited as this is intended as a feature change list (however a few bug fixes are still listed).

Changes in 2.55:
- &amp;filled=1 added onto links for searching for member's submitted links and comments in search results (searchall.tpl, searchmembers.tpl). This applies only to english-only installs (multilingual is already correct in 2.54).
- People with no template set selected will no longer get a parse error message on the admin panel's settings page.
- An odd host-specific intermitent warning message has been removed. (Seemed to occour on discount-hosting.com, yet not on other safe mode hosts for unknown reasons.)
- The advanced SQL-level filtering option on the settings page has been repaired to work correctly.
- Error reporting fix for those on misconfigured hosts which default to showing all notices.
- Random sort order option tossed into the settings template (you could have added it before anyhow).
- Tossed in thumbnail.php in case anyone wants to show thumbnails of images. Just use <img src="thumbnail.php?id={LINKID}&thumbwidth=50&thumbheight=50"> to make a 50x50 thumbnail of an attached image.
- Do in-category searches using this form action in displaylinks.tpl: search.php?filled=1&whichtype=links&catid={CATID}
- {CATISSUBCATEGORYOF[x]} now available. Example: <IF {CATISSUBCATEGORYOF[2]}>We're in a subcategory of category #2</IF>
