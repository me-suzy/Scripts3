Smart Search version 4.21
=========================

Instructions:

1. Open the Smart Search zip file (the one without 'MySQL' in the filename) 
   and follow the instructions in setup_instructions.html to install the script.

Before doing anything, login to the admin and setup the script (click on the "Settings" link).
Before upgrading from a version older than 4.0, make sure the script is installed properly and that everything works. 
Only then should you follow the upgrade instructions in setup_instructions.html
Don't delete your old files for at least a week.

2. If you want to accept payments with Smart Search, then open the Payment Gateway zip file and 
   follow the instructions in its own setup_instructions.html file.
   Do this before upgrading from an old version of Smart Search as well.

3. If you want to use the optional MySQL database add-on, then open the MySQL zip file and follow
   the instructions in its setup_instructions.html file.
