Fixes as of 2005-09-26:
=======================
1: Replace the files on your web-server with the corresponding files from the fix-file.
   There are no datbase changes, only some file changes

2: Fix-files will not over-write your custom strings anymore IF you make a file called
   lang_xxx_override.php where xxx is the lang_xxx.php file that you have edited strings
