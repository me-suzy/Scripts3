/**************************************************************
 * Important stuff
**************************************************************/
Some items to resolve right away:
	- Tab-spaces for all files is:	4-char (spaces / tab)
	  (may need to adjust editor program preferences)

	- Unix type text file. All files are created and edited
	  as "unix text" files. Be careful of editors saving in
	  DOS, or MAC type files- always use unix.
	  (may need to adjust editor program preferences)

	- Where to install?
	  Make the decision to either run phpcoin as a website
	  or as an addon to existing website. Basically you need
	  to decide on a folder or directory to plop the files in.

	- Backup your database before giving me a whack at it.
