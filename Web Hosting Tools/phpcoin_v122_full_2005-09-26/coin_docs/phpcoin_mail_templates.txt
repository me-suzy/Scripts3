Hello $_MTP[to_name],

Welcome!  Thank you for choosing $_MTP[site] for your hosting needs.

This email contains vital information about your server account. Please read it thoroughly and print these pages or copy to a safe place.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.	General Client Profile Information
-------------------------------------------------------------

$_MTP[cl_info]

-------------------------------------------------------------
2.	General Account Information
-------------------------------------------------------------

To log into your account, please access:

$_MTP[si_cp_url]
 or:
https://$_MTP[si_ip]:$_MTP[si_cp_url_port]/login.php3

Server Name:	$_MTP[si_name]
IP Address:		$_MTP[si_ip]  (shared)
Domain Name:	$_MTP[dom_domain]
POP Server:		mail.$_MTP[dom_domain]
SMTP Server:	mail.$_MTP[dom_domain]

Nameservers:	$_MTP[si_ns_01]  (IP: $_MTP[si_ns_01_ip])
				$_MTP[si_ns_02]  (IP: $_MTP[si_ns_02_ip])

Plesk Username:	$_MTP[dom_user_name_cp]
Plesk Password:	$_MTP[dom_user_pword_cp]

FTP Username:	$_MTP[dom_user_name_ftp]
FTP Password:	$_MTP[dom_user_pword_ftp]
FTP URL:		ftp.$_MTP[dom_domain]  (once resolved)

Please remember that it will take a short time for your Registrar to process the delegation request and for this new DNS to propagate around the internet. During that time, you will not be able to access this site as normal through a web browser. However, you can still access your site during this period by pointing your browser to:

		http://$_MTP[si_ip]/~$_MTP[dom_user_name_ftp]

Please note that CGI and PHP will not function properly while view your site through this special IP address. It is just a temporary measure to assist you in preparing your site while your new DNS transfer around the net.

You can upload your site by pointing your FTP software to your shared IP address ($_MTP[si_ip]). This means that you do not have to wait for your domain name to be transferred to our servers before you can upload your site. Once your domain has fully propagated around the net, you will be able to access your FTP account via your own domain name.


-------------------------------------------------------------
3.	Once your domain resolves:
-------------------------------------------------------------

	Your webmail URL is:	http://webmail.$_MTP[dom_domain]

	Your Webstats URL is:	http://$_MTP[dom_domain]/webstat/
	(stats can also be viewed from control panel)


-------------------------------------------------------------
4.	Setting Up An Email Account
-------------------------------------------------------------

	Before you can start sending or receiving email, you must
	set up at least one email account.  To do this, please

		($_MTP[si_cp_url])
		using your control panel username and password.

	2. Click on the MAIL button.

	3. Enter the mail name that you want to create (i.e. "bob",
		"editor", "webmaster" etc., not the full address).

	4. Click on the ADD button

	5. Check/Tick the "Mailbox" box

	6. Enter and confirm a password that you would like to use

	7. Scroll down to the bottom and click UPDATE


-------------------------------------------------------------
5.	Billing Information
-------------------------------------------------------------

	Paypal:			- Charge will appear as "Paypal"
	Credit Card:	- Charge will appear as "2CheckOut.com Inc."

Regardless of the method you selected, you will receive an order confirmation email detailing your order information.
