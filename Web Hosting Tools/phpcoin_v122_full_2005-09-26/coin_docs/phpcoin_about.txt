/**************************************************************
 * Introduction: phpCOIN package
**************************************************************/
The phpCOIN package (set of scripts) was originally designed
for (re)sellers of web services, but now can be used by any
small busines, to manage their clients:
	- Provides Interface for Client information.
	- Provides Interface for Client placed orders.
	- Provides Interface for Admin generated multi-item invoices.
	- Provides basic contact emails (two-way).
	- Admin defined products, vendors, and vendor products.
	- Automated overdue reminders,
	- And a whole bunch more.

The general requirements for running the phpCOIN package are:
	- Ability to FTP files to website critical.
	- A mySQL database on your current website host.
	- Ability to manage mySQL database (for backup / debug )
	  (using phpMyAdmin or some equal)
	- Ability to edit some config files (unix text file)
	- Website running database server mySQL 3.x.x or better.
	- Website running php 4.1.2 or better.
	- Some patience. :)

/**************************************************************
 * Important stuff
**************************************************************/
Some items to resolve right away:
	- Tab-spaces for all files is:	4-char (spaces / tab)
	  (may need to adjust editor program preferences)

	- Unix type text file. All files are created and edited
	  as "unix text" files. Be careful of editors saving in
	  DOS, or MAC type files- always use unix.
	  (may need to adjust editor program preferences)

	- Where to install?
	  Make the decision to either run phpcoin as a website
	  or as an addon to existing website. Basically you need
	  to decide on a folder or directory to plop the files in.

	- This is a hobby project, go easy on me :)

	- Congratulations for reading to the bottom of this stuff.
	  Most just gloss over- you should be commended.
