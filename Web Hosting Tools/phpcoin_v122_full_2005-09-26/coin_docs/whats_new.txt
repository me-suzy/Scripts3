XSS ENHANCEMENTS:
=================
phpCOIN has undergone radical surgery to eliminate as much as possible
any xss or sql injection attacks.  This even includes exploits that do
no harm, but make it appear to the newbie that phpCOIN may be hackable.



DIRECTORY STRUCTURE CHANGES:
============================
The odd web-host servers sites from directories that have /admin in
the path.  This caused problems with phpCOIN's automatic "where am I"
code, so to eliminate this issue all phpCOIN sub-directories are now
prefixed with /coin_



FILE DOWNLOAD FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDED:
=====================================
The 'downloads' add-on is now incorporated into the base phpCOIN package

The URL for displaying downloads is mod.php?mod=downloads.

Downloads will be grouped by "group" on the downloads page.  An admin
control panel is included so you can change the information in the
database for the downloads.  To get the files onto the web-server, you
must still use an FTP client because the Control Panel does not include
upload capabilities.




SELF-CONTAINED ADD-ONS:
=======================
Self-contained add-ons such as htmlarea (WYSIWYG siteinfo/email editing)
must be placed in the coin_addons directory. To install add-ons to phpCOIN
such as htmlarea:

	1) Create a folder within coin_addons called /htmlarea

	2) Unzip the contents of the htmlarea download into the folder created
	   above.

	3) phpCOIN will automatically recognize that this add-on is installed,
	   and use it where appropriate.
