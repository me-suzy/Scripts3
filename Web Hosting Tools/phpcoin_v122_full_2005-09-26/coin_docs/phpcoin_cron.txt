phpCOIN can handle several functions automatically on a schedule.

These functions are in files in the /coin_cron directory, and must be called via cron
or via Windows Task Scheduler.

If called via cron, you have the option of calling via wget or a similar program
to simulate the files being called from a web-browser. In that event, you need do
nothing else other than schedule the jobs.

If you do NOT want to use wget or similar program you can call the files normally,
but you MUST edit /coin_cron/cron_config.php first, to setup the information that would
be known IF the files were called via web-browser.
