/**************************************************************
 * What Now:
**************************************************************/
The following assumes all has installed properly, and are ready
to go further. So here we go.

In the event you encounter bugs, or have problems with something,
please visit the forum:

	http://forums.phpcoin.com

If you are unsure how to use a feature or perform an action,
please visit the user manual
	http://coin_docs.phpcoin.com


The concepts:
- Admins and Users
	- Separate entities. User, or better yet- Clients, are
	  generated when an order is placed. Admin can create.
	- Initial default is no clients, and one admin as mentioned
	  in the install doc.
	- Admins are that administrators- full access.
	- Clients (users) are limited and can only see what info
	  pertains to them (their orders, info, etc.).

	NOTE:	It is recommended that the site admin also initiate
			an order to become a client, cancel before payment.
			Use site as domain. This will let you test client
			features, etc..

- Orders
	- To go to order directly from an icon for a specific product,
		<a href="mod.php?mod=orders&ord_prod_id=1">Order Prod #1</a>

	- Orders are placed via the Place Orders link and the
	  following should happen:
	  - Step 1: User must accepts TOS and AUP policies.
				Selects product and vendor (payment method).
	  			OR selects Custom Order request.
	  			See forum for info on COR:
	  			http://www.phpcoin.com/addons/ibf/index.php?showtopic=34

	  - Step 2: Fills in required info to setup account.
	  - Step 4: Place Order / Final confirmation of information.
	  	- If continued and normal order:
	  		- Client is created in Clients table
	  		- Order is created in Orders table, linked to client
	  		- Domain is put in domains table (will tie in servers)
	  		- Lookup Vendor Product (prod id and vend id selected)
	  		  to get the appropriate payment link.
	  		- Display Payment link on final screen.

	  	- If continued and Custom Order Request (COR):
	  		- Client is created in Clients table
	  		- Email sent to site admin and client with summary of the
	  		  custom order request.
	  		- Display message and info on final screen.

	  - Step 5: Third Party Billing (normal order)
	    - User clicks on order payment link provided
	    - Takes the person to the pay link for the third party
	      billing site. Out of phpCOIN site / code at this point.

	  - Step 6: Client returns from third party billing (normal order)
	    - User present with either "buy" or "cancel" message.
	    - Future will trigger from this.

	  - Step 7: You go from here.
	  	- Tools are in place to let you send order
	  	  confirmation emails, server account activation emails.
	  	- Client can come and login and view their info.

	- Existing clients should login prior to placing orders.
	  - Will load their information (they can edit).
	  - A new client will not be created when order placed.
	  - A existing client can place orders for existing domain, new
	    clients cannot.

	- Aborted orders. If user does place order (which inserts
	  into your database) but dosen't click pay link, you'll
	  get a dead order.

- Support Data
	- Naturally there is support data that is required for the
	  site. Things like products, vendors, etc. are required to
	  be setup. So be sure to review / add (from admin menu)
	  the following:
	  - Admin Information

	  - FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) is empty (sorry).

	  - Products- appear in select list when placing order.

	  - Vendors- appear in select list when placing order.

	  - Vendors Products- ties the two together for order link

	  - Mail Contacts- Contact email addresses. Default four
	    are required and should not be editid except to correct
	    the address.

	  - SiteInfo Pages- SiteInfo module is for creating / editing
	    many of the "site info" pages. Pages are created and can
	    be displayed in content area. The following items are
	    provided as SiteInfo pages:

	    	- Site Index
	    	- Announcement (turn on and visible above index)
	    	- About Us page
	    	- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
	    	- Banned Code Policy
	    	- Privacy Policy
	    	- Terms Of Service (TOS)

		Call a Siteinfo page by ID:
			<a href="mod.php?mod=siteinfo&id=3">Show SiteInfo #3</a>

		So to edit these, use the Admin SiteInfo editor. HMTL works.

	  - Pages- this module is similar to SiteInfo but with slightly
	    different options. Pages can be assigned to Topic or
	    Category. HTML and javascript (should) code works.

		Call a Page by ID:
			<a href="mod.php?mod=pages&mode=view&id=3">Show Page #3</a>

	  - Menu blocks- required to setup if displaying side menu columns
	    (like at phpmywebthing.com)
	    It is recommended that menu columns only be used if going 100%
	    width (assuming most users are 1024 x 768)


- Server Account Activation emails
	- See forum note on explanation that goes along with this (sorry):
		http://www.phpcoin.com/addons/ibf/index.php?showtopic=33


- Payment Links
	- See forum note on explanation that goes along with this (sorry):
		http://www.phpcoin.com/addons/ibf/index.php?showtopic=24

	- Currently (2) billing Vendors are exampled in the package.
		- Paypal.com
		- 2Checkout.com

	  Other Billing Vendors will work, provided buy parameter and value
	  have been properly set in product information.

	- When the client makes it to the screen that displays the payment link,
	  the code locates and loads the payment link for the vendor product
	  (see below), and preforms a search and replace for the pre-defined
	  string and basically inserts the order id number.

		Legacy- to be removed post V1.2.0
		# Get 2checkout.com params
			$data['credit_card_processed']	= $_GPV[credit_card_processed];
			$data['merchant_order_id']		= $_GPV[merchant_order_id];

		# Get PayPal.com params
			$data['buy']					= $_GPV[buy];
			$data['order_id'] 				= $_GPV[order_id];

		Current V1.2.0 and later:
		# Search and replace parameters in string (V1.2)
			<prod_id>
			<prod_name>
			<prod_desc>
			<prod_unit_cost>
			<order_id>
			<ord_unit_cost>
			<ord_company>
			<ord_name_first>
			<ord_name_last>
			<ord_name_full>
			<ord_addr_01>
			<ord_addr_02>
			<ord_city>
			<ord_state_prov>
			<ord_country>
			<ord_zip_code>
			<ord_phone>
			<ord_email>
			<ord_optfld_01>
			<ord_optfld_02>
			<ord_optfld_03>
			<ord_optfld_04>
			<ord_optfld_05>
			# For paypal
				<return_link_buy>
				<return_link_cancel>
